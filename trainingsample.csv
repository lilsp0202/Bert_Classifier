The benefits I think we will see from the changes we are making to our reinsurance that I alluded to in my remarks are amounts that we will see flow through in the subsequent five or six quarters. It had very little impact in the first quarter. We will see more of that to come.,55,No
"I would just add one more thing. While we should be taking more risk net as we can certainly handle the volatility, if reinsurance pricing continues to come down, as I said in my opening remarks we are more of a buyer than a seller of reinsurance then we may start buying again. But you can ask me about that later in the year.",64,No
"Ken, I don't have that number at my fingertips, but it is well over $100 million, so we have got more than enough capacity. And I would simply say that the Board has shown a willingness each time we have gotten close to exhausting a prior authorization to renew that authorization.",51,No
"I think the only part of the segment that I didn't reference in my remarks, Bijan, was Trident. Trident's premium was down slightly for the quarter. That is our public entity business. And we didn't see any adverse reserve development from Trident for the quarter. That doesn't mean we won't see any for the rest of the year, but I think we have got it going in the right direction right now. We will know for sure on the first of July because that is the big renewal date for public entities. Many of them buy their insurance on that day. But for the most part I think Commercial Specialty is now heading in the right direction, and our strategy is to keep on executing and staying focused on specific industries that we serve within that segment.",137,Yes
"No, nothing has changed. I have been an investor and member of the Board of Directors of this Company for the last 15 years. I have been running it for the last 14. We have made a dozen acquisitions along the way, and I think we have taken what was a small regional franchise in the U.S. and turned it into an International Specialty company and we still have got a long way to go.",75,No
"So, yes, the -- , production target, [all which we] said introduce the 3D products last quarter, those are the productions targeted for sometime early next year. So --and then, we are not stopping still, like we are also building newer devices, some of them could simply be like a stripped down device, let's say, for the lower end market. Some of them will be newer generation, even more advanced solutions. So as we build more advanced solutions, the price obviously will go up.
 But as we also build lower price market for, let's say, for new generations for either the ultra book that require much lower cost solution those price will be -- designed to be obviously to be lower cost. But the volume will be much higher. So we are -- and those are not cannibalizing the existing market, those will just be addressing new market opportunity. So we feel good that this is a business that we invested properly many, many years earlier, before anybody thought it was important to invest in this area.",177,Yes
"Right. So there will be a lot of, obviously, we are the first to enter -- I mean, the only one still in the Chromecast market. We believe there will be significant opportunities to continue to invest in building more advanced Chromecast devices to address better new generation codec H.2265], VP9s. Okay, so you can think about the Chromecast as the device, like a set-top box, like a micro set-top box, set-top box inside a dongle. So the difference between that versus the real set-top box, the real set-top box will have more memory, little bit more features. And as a result, it is also natural for us to address. That is why when we say we have several design wins on the ARMADA 1500 set-top box SoCs. So this is just actually the same family of products, just one optimized for the dongle, the other one more optimized for the set-top box. So the set-top box, it's a new business for us, but as we have proven to -- as we prove our self to be -- to serve this market we believe in the long run, we could grow this business, as well.",195,Yes
"Yes. Okay. Obviously, the ultra low cost is going to be slightly lower margin than the higher end. That is always going to be the case, but the volumes are going to be so much bigger. But you also need to be -- to put it into perspective, that in the 3G we have a lot more competition today than in the 4G. 4Gs we are talking about something -- just today there is three, three suppliers. So, three suppliers versus more than like six, seven suppliers in the 3G. The market profile is going to be significantly better in the LTE space.",103,Yes
"(Laughter). Yes, I did say that. I did say that $100 million was on the high end, but I still believe it's still on the high end. But nobody knows what is going to happen in December of this year. But based on the rate they are running, I think maybe a little higher than our earlier projection, but -- ?",61,Yes
"Well, the tax rate is affected by releases of accruals, based on reserves that were set up because of liabilities in foreign countries. And when those statutes of limitations and those liabilities expire, it provides a reversal of the reserve. Going forward, we believe the rate is going to be less than 5% for the year, and subject of to these kinds of fluctuations that occur because of accounting reasons.",70,No
"So I think, if we had not spent on TV, most of that money would have dropped to the bottom line. We already spend in our other channels at a pretty aggressive rate. So certainly we could have used those dollars to -- we could have used the dollars to spend at a loss in other channels, but that would be contrary to the direction that we always head.",69,No
"Sure. I will start.
 We generally consider the traffic to our site to be about half and half. Half hotel shoppers, half looking to either plan the rest of the trip or looking around at what to do or where to eat locally. So I think about half and half. We already shared the 2 billion unique visitor number that Google Analytics reports.",63,Yes
"Yes. And it's whether they are landing on the meta-search pages, or frankly anywhere on the site, we made some nice progress in getting travelers to move down the funnel to both check more prices on properties, as well as follow through and to actually click through to our clients.
 One of the things that we theorize on the backs of increased CPC from our clients, is that the leads that we are sending folks, as of now, is better. They are more valuable than the leads we might've been sending them six months ago based upon the work that the team has done on the site. So a more qualified visitor leads TripAdvisor further down the buying cycle in their minds. So when they land on a partner site, they are more likely to finish the transaction.
 We also just have a lot more, or many more, clients who are active in the auction on many of our different points of sale. So that extra competition, I'm sure, has played a part in the price increases that we've seen recently.",181,Yes
"It is certainly a fair point. That would certainly account for a bit. Again the factors in there are the amount of our mobile usage app versus web, and the timing over which people move from the partial native app to the full native app. We need to go back and look at that.
 When we report over Q1, as we will have had a full quarter of fully native, I think we will have a bunch of that tracked at that point. And will be a great question to revisit. But short answer, I think you are right. We're missing some hotel shoppers in that number there.",108,Yes
"Great question. As we look at that, it does include shoppers on the TripAdvisor mobile website. But due to essentially, some challenges around the moving from -- how to explain it -- we had, over the course of the year, a native app that was partially what's called a web view. So it uses some webpages as part of the app, and so those would be counted, naturally, I believe, as part of the hotel shopper metric.
 When we launched the full native app for those that downloaded the full native app, those would not be included in the hotel shopper metrics. Not that they shouldn't be, but because, technically, we are not able to do that at this moment in time. Hotel shoppers also don't include our hotel shoppers on daodao, our China website. They don't include to the best of my recollection, our native shoppers on Android, as well as iPhone.",153,Yes
"So we've drawn down 10.25 -- sorry, the warrants that have been issued, 6.25 million on the consummation of the deal, and 4 million on the $20 million drawdown. So there are 10 million warrants that are associated with the Company's ability to draw down up to $50 million. So we drew down $20 million for the first tranche, so it's essentially 40% of the 10 million, so that's how we came up with the 4 million warrants that we now consider the draw warrants. So 10.25 million warrants valued at the end of March 31 actually at $10.4 million so we had a slight charge in the P&amp;L.",109,No
"Yes. So the state mandatory reimbursement reduction was part of the Japanese plan from the beginning of the year and is still a part of the Japanese plan as we go forward. So obviously the kind of growth that we saw in Q1 will moderate, I think, as the year progresses so we need to factor that in.
 Overall, if you can strip away the French commercial restructuring which was about $5.5 million to $6.5 million year-over-year, we're seeing improvements in our core European businesses, and frankly we're looking forward to registration approvals in China and Brazil for the Alphatec products that we think provide some upside to our plan. They're not built into the plan right now. So I feel pretty good that the international team is focused. We're focusing on some of our core markets, and we're deploying the Alphatec business into those markets. I think probably, of note, all of our shipments, [Syotec] and Alphatec products, now come from Carlsbad. So Mike Plunkett's team has complete responsibility for global shipments now, and we've executed that transition pretty much flawlessly from a customer service perspective. So I feel pretty good that international's performing well.",196,Yes
"I definitely would say we probably saw more reimbursement pushbacks in lumbar in Q1 than we did on the cervical side. I think there's been some pushback on the cervical side for the peak interbodies as opposed to the biologics. So we definitely felt some of that. So I guess internally, we tend to look at cervical as a higher growth category than lumbar. But having said that, when you're introducing products like Solus for a company our size, the newer technologies tend to make more of a difference. So we may not really be a proxy for the category given some of the focuses of the new products.",109,Yes
"I mean, we're into the [bone rate] on development for our Pedicle screw system, so I'm not capitalizing beta sets because there's a high likelihood that they're going to modified and revised. So it's a little high right now in the first half of the year. As we get through some of that understanding, it will moderate in the back half of the year.",64,Yes
"Yes. Absolutely. So biologics, obviously in the first quarter felt the impact of the discontinuation of PureGen. Actually they're performing well through their internal plan. They've added a ProFuse chip product to the line which is really accelerating the ProFuse growth. Corex is certainly opening some doors for the biologic group so it will continue to grow.
 The products that you're going to see coming out in the first half of the year are really going to be our new medical screw system -- sorry, the second half of the year. But that is a complete system that will do [degeneration], the entire work, so that's pretty exciting.
 AutoLock which was the Phygen patented screw system will be coming out. But really, we'll be expanding around the ILLICO system of minimally-invasive surgery in the second half of the year once we get the Pedicle screw system out.",147,Yes
"Kevin, we talked about seeing as a company with a weaker mix of business a little different -- margins get perturbed a little bit, because metals over time is -- you don't typically make margin on metals. But we have seen in the mid double digits 13 to 15. That was back in the '96, '97 timeframe. With a little higher metals and maybe less ebullient (ph) times, I would certainly hope that we would target more than doubling where we currently are. So that would say that you would hope deep in the cycle when you begin to get the raw materials to stabilize, or maybe even break off a little bit, that we would see the high single digits and above that. In some of our businesses we're already operating in those levels, and I think that's -- for my own view, and certainly from my team, that is where we're headed. But we are not going to put a set piece forecast on that. I think we have the ability to see that again, which is obviously very powerful in terms of the earnings side of this thing as we get deeper into the cycle.",198,Yes
"This is Greg. Just commenting further on Jeff's question. We have inventory. We have talked about that being depending on what you're making 15 to 20 cents on the dollar in terms of absorption. So 30 million was the actual inventory roughly that order times 15 is 4.5 million, and then we talked about as a positive if you want to think about it that way -- it's obviously some smoothing with the first quarter. And then with respect to metals, we had roughly 60 million pounds at 10 cents, which is $6 million a headwind. That 60 million would be roughly what the metal that's priced to market in the quarter. So that's 6 million on the negative, plus the Sarbanes-Oxley of 2.8 million, so we are about 88 of headwind and 4 or 5 million of tailwind. If you try to get it that way I'm doing this without precision but trying to give you an order of magnitude, Jeff. Is there any other questions?",167,Yes
"Yes, Marty. I would plan one thing as it relates to '04 -- the impact that the metals had on the working capital. We sold between 35 and 40 million pounds of metal a month, (indiscernible) year-over-year we saw close to a 50 cent per pound rise in the copper. So if you look at the build that we had in the net or in the gross debt for the full year, it's pretty much attributable to the rise in copper and the impact that had on our working capital -- obviously our inventories get inflated, outwork receivables get inflated; and we get some help on the payable side. But looking forward to next year, assuming roughly the same level of earnings -- because we haven't given guidance I would point you there to start. We think we could probably take -- again, assuming the copper space relatively flat where it is now, so we're not getting either inflation or deflationary effect from the copper. That we're probably looking at taking out 20 to $25 billion worth of debt for '05. And that assumes we get some out of the inventory.",191,Yes
"It seems to be pretty much the same but it's too early to say whether there will be -- we think that it will be relatively stable as opposed to continuing to push off. We saw that a bit in the last two quarters. As Jim said, end of the year purchasing is always a bit of an unknown, and it relates to budget dollars that are still available, etcetera.",70,No
"Pat, a couple of things. One is the Sarbanes effort is -- for all companies is a massive undertaking. We like many companies, we have had to use outside contractors, and we are now stepping up some of that internally because it is an ongoing process. I would guess that we should be able to year-over-year reduce this by -- I'm targeting by half. Again, this is a moving target. I think between both the work that has been done and then the work that we will do, we will reduce this, because it is a very meaningful cost. And I guess the other thing is we try to apply our lean techniques around how do you get better and better at this and do it more and more efficiently as well as take the good lessons out of it with respect to best process. So we will turn it into much like we do with any manufacturing or process issue, we will just keep getting better at it and drive it down, and we'll also look at it as an opportunity rather than in a sense a negative on the enterprise. I think we can take lessons out of it and continue to improve what we do. I think maybe drop it by half, perhaps, Pat; maybe not quite that much but close to it, and that should help us in '05.",233,No
"Well no, but you see, it does. It does. And Wendy can give you the details. We did not accrue but did not forgive (ph) rent for '02, '03 from CLC. Remember we kept saying, ""We know we will get that at some point."" We just can't prove it because we know what the shares are worth and, also, it includes interest for that. So it does include. That is why it is different. I mean, let me try to normalize that although, God, it is a dangerous exercise to try to normalize. And one always regrets any time one does that but I will do it anyway, being that I never learn.
 Excluding that, I would say, we would be in $1.61 to $1.65 range, plus or minus. Which is not very different. I think you're saying $1.64, Jerry, I mean it is somewhere as I said $1.61 to $1.65 depending on how good Clint is here and we are looking at him and he is smiling. So he probably will do well.
 But that is what it is.",180,No
"Yes, yes, I mean the factory is full. I have to tell you, Clint here is working very diligently and he is very busy. And that is very good. We are out there. We have begun visiting customers. Now people are getting to realize that LTC is open for business. We are getting our old customers to begin calling us on deals. We find the competition to be more in our niche of the market. The small transactions. From the floating rates, short-term lenders like cap source and others, Red Capital (ph) and others.
 But, effectively, we are still able to do business. We are very optimistic about the future.",110,Yes
"It's been a long, it's been a long 4 years and let me tell you we -- I remember spending last year Memorial Day weekend, I was working so was Wendy and she and I were working on Labor Day weekend, trying to do another deal involved with us. Finally we worked between Christmas and New Year and this time, it happened. Three is the charm, they say and so it is.",72,No
"Something like that. And that will fluctuate, of course, depending on how we do the rest of the year. So please don't hold us to that. The range we are trying to hit and the range we will be decide the dividend on is the non-recurring part, excluding these holdings.
 Having said that I want to take credit for those -- not I -- we want to take credit for those things because we took the blame when they weren't getting the rent. They kept saying, ""Well you're not getting any rent."" And we kept saying, ""You're right. We are not getting that. We hope to get it (indiscernible)."" We got it and in a sense we feel vindicated. I must say that.",123,No
"No. I think we will wait until year-end because if you recall we raised it the third quarter last year. Raised it to 30 cents in the third quarter, I believe. So the earliest we would want to review that is against the third quarter and we will stay with that 75 percent plus or minus (indiscernible) 75 percent payout.
 Again the Board may change our mind. But for the moment we, here in the management group, believe this low payout is a good idea. It gives us additional growth. It gives us cash, it helps us continue the deleveraging although I think we have gotten probably as far as they should deleveraging. Wendy was making fun of me the other day, she says, ""You don't have any more debt to restructure! What are you going to restructure with?""
 I was laughing. I said, ""Maybe we don't want any debt for a little bit so we don't have anything to restructure."" But absent something, if all of it doesn't, instead of my expectations of 10, 10, 10 we were flooded with deals maybe we looked at it earlier. But right now, I don't know. Wendy, what's your --?",198,No
"Not really. It was pretty diverse, Wilson, on the commercial side and it was spread very evenly between our construction lines and our real estate lines and then really we had a nice increase in our C&amp;I prices and that represents I think about $46 to $47 million in that growth.",51,Yes
"I think that 1.9 was about maybe $650,000 over prior-year period. So, we've seen a nice increase. I think the new business goal for the year was about 85% of that already through the first six months and probably 60% of that business is bank referred business over to the agency. We are just real pleased. We know our whole process is working. And another thing, in that industry, one of the key indicators is what they call the 'close the book,' and I think in the last couple of months we've had right around the 60% number, where the industry as you know, averages remain in the 35, high 30%. So, roughly we get a high level of referral (indiscernible).",121,Yes
"We have our asset person sitting here, and I would say, there hasn't been much change from prior quarters on our asset sensitivity. We've still an awful lot of those new commercial loans coming in are still prime based and LIBOR based adding on to the balances, and the Green Plan has helped that asset sensitivity somewhat, but at this point, we're still within policy, but still slightly asset sensitive.",70,No
"Yes, there were a couple of questions that were e-mailed to me that I would maybe just take a minute to go over most of it. We have covered most of it. The first question was the increase in our linked quarter non-interest income, where you talked about the NSF fees, we talked about the increase in wealth management, insurance somewhat flat and also the mortgage banking on a linked quarter basis, but also included in there, again we had to gain on the (indiscernible), the commercial loan swaps and we are seeing some very nice steady increases in our debit and credit card transaction income on a linked quarter basis year-to-year. And the other question I had was what about the increase in non-interest expense on our linked quarter, which is about $600,000. If you recall, during the first quarter this year, we had several charges related to facilities where we had implemented some new leasehold depreciations, we had abandoned the building, and wrote off some equipment. We had donated another one, and that accounts for the biggest piece of that -- this increase. And we already answered the question about where we thought the loan loss reserve is going to end up.",204,Yes
"Yes, Wilson. I was looking at that. Somebody else had e-mailed me some questions. But the first quarter was exceptionally strong. Also included in those numbers were some revenue sources from our credit, our title insurance both on the retail and the commercial side that we weren't able to repeat this year. But we are not entirely optimistic on that line of business.",63,Yes
"We are finding them and it is working. See, we bring a couple of things to the table that we have very little competition for. One is we have a national footprint for our services department. Very few people have that. The - - in the entire Nortel community, there's maybe only one or two companies could make that same claim. That they have a coast-to-coast, company employees. And were leveraging that and people are finding that - - customers find that makes life a lot easier to them when they have a national project that they need. For instance, Greg alluded to three new large customers that we added, one of which was a large oil company. And what they wanted us to do was go to all their gas stations, which, I don't know how many states there were, but a lot of them. And do some wiring work and some stuff on their IT equipment at each gas station. Well - -",165,Yes
"In the past what they had to do was regionalize that. The poor guy that worked for this oil company, his job was to look in his rolodex and find out who does this kind of stuff in Texas. And you'd call that guy. And then who does it in Kansas. And who does it in California. And he'd have 15 or 20 contractors out there. Well, each of those contractors would vary as far as the performance and the quality of work and billing and all those issues and his life was miserable. This was a big project for him. Well, when he works with XETA, we sat down with him. What do you want done? How do you want the billing? It all went so slick, that he just can't believe it. So, that is the kind of thing that we do. And we are way beyond break and fix, too. You have got to think of us - - we're - - this term ""managed services"". We are pretty much involved with practically anything that these people need done insofar as their IT equipment is concerned. I am not saying we will take on anything. But we will take an to broad range of things. And that makes us a very useful tool to people like this large oil company that I was describing.",227,Yes
"As you know, Jeff, with our installation of RFID in Decathlon in France, we utilized our Wirama technology in the antennas.
 As I mentioned with the North American retailer that we are not disclosing at this point, we are changing out all of their antennas chain-wide so that they are in a position to utilize the RFID technology -- Wirama technology at the point of exit as they expand their RFID program with us.
 And then thirdly, the Asian EAS swap out, clearly a big piece of that was wrapped around positioning for the transition to RFID as EAS and using RFID. And I'm hopeful that we will also be able to install the Wirama technology.",116,Yes
"Hey, Jeff, it's Jim. Most of our EAS antenna production -- basically all of our EAS antenna production -- is in China. And the exchange rate difference you will see in our supplement presentation of China versus the US dollar has not been nearly as significant as many of the other countries that we sell into.",56,Yes
"Yes, I think -- two things. One is, as we've talked before, this has been fits and starts in this evolution of MV and the whole RFID initiative. And whether it was 2008 and pulling back on capital by the retailers or it was the Round Rock patent litigation, there always seemed to be something getting in the way. Of course, it started with the cost been very high.
 Now the cost has come down; it's very affordable. The ROI is there. Online e-commerce is a real threat to retailers. It's expanded tremendously, where a greater portion of sales are coming from online. And then the other apparel retailers are adopting RFID and their competitors see it. And they know that they need to start the process, because it does take time. So I think all of these things coming together are influencing the pace at which we will see the adoption going forward.",154,Yes
"(interpreted) Well, just remember the figures for the first half, EUR250 million minus EUR250 million for the full year. So there's a second half that's more favorable, as I showed on sales. But it's also true for profits. If you look by quarter, we should be at minus EUR40 million Q3, and up EUR10 million in Q4. So we had a positive upside in currency in Q4. But it's dampened by two key factors.
 Firstly, all currencies didn't perform well. The yen slid. The euro-- no need to recall what happened. Second thing that's always fundamental to understand the ForEx impact, when currencies rise, there's no currency appreciation. It doesn't mean we have losses. We had considerable increases. We had good hedges [that had won] a lot of money.
 So full year, our hedges generated the same profit as last year than in 2013, but far more in the first half than in the second half. So there's an imbalance over the year. But all in all, we have a normal trend on the currency impact across the year.
 As to giving you directions to model it, I mean it's difficult enough for us. It's not easy. I'm delighted to see that a brilliant analyst doesn't understand any better than I do, currency fluctuations.",214,No
"(interpreted) The end of the year was good for Louis Vuitton, mostly thanks to the new launches. But also because of the significant growth in the American market. And we certainly intend to continue innovating and launching new products, month on month at Louis Vuitton. And we're very confident. I mean at the beginning, at the first weeks of the year have started extremely well.
 Don't derive from this that we will enjoy huge growth levels. That's not the purpose. I mean the main concept for us is to make our customers happy, to increase, as I said, desirability. But if it means that people have to wait a bit longer to get their new leather goods or whatnot, well they'll have to wait that much longer, even if it means less revenue right now.
 But I mean, because of the size of the market, if we launch a new product, you distribute it around the world. We don't always have the distribution and production capacity to meet demand, especially as customers are particularly keen to buy new products. But that strategy, we will certainly continue. It's always more fun to look at new products than existing products.",198,Yes
"Why not? But we don't see right now any brand to divest. What we have in the plan is something different. For instance, for a brand like Marc Jacobs, we said that we are aiming to do an IPO with it. Because it's a brand in which we are going to be relatively different niche of the market, more competitive to some other brands, like if you know Michael Kors, which is not exactly-- it's more a competitor with price points that are lower and coming from the US. And for that brand we are managing it differently. We're managing it with a US team that is really motivated by the growth and the potential IPO, just to give an example.
 If you take what is the market cap now of Michael Kors, I don't know. But it's above 10 billion. If the team succeeds in doing that, maybe at that time we can do another very good dividend for our shareholders, maybe. But success is never a guarantee.",169,Yes
"I think we have to aim for a good equilibrium. We are looking to grow, but as I said, it's not the main object. The main objective is really to stay at the top of desirability, and two profitability and return is also an objective. And we see with this opportunity of Marc Jacobs, a way to maybe do it again in a few years, maybe. But it's an equilibrium.
 And we have other ideas of the same kind. But it's early to discuss. So maybe the last question?",89,No
"(interpreted) Now about provisions, I expected the question, and I tried to get an answer. But we have as many as 60 brands. And it's pretty difficult to know. I mean we have a bit more than 50, but it's less than 100. But we have some reversals of provisions in 2013 not repeated in 2014, some reversals in 2014. It's not complicated, but you have a lengthy list. And it's pretty difficult to have-- but we have about between EUR50 million and EUR100 million all in all in provisions above EBIT.",92,No
"As you can see from slide 14, in cost of labor we had an increase of EUR46 million, which is, I would say, almost explained by the extraordinary items, or the non-recurring items that we have described to you in slide number 6.
 As Marco explained well to you before, and particularly on the change of the salary increase, the salary increase occurred last year in April 2014, which means that from April 2015 we will compare every month with a number which implies the similar contract, and will be homogeneous; which means that the discontinued will be limited just to the first three months.
 Excluding these one-off items, I would say that the cost of labor is expected to be stable, or with a slight increase, but very, very slight; something in the region of 1%, 2%, maybe 1% increase, so nothing significant.",144,No
"Yes, thanks. On the volume-driven cost, as you can see from slide 15, in general, the principle is that the ratio between the revenues and the volume-driven cost is stable. And this is also the case in the first quarter results.
 There are two exceptions, which, of course, has an immediate counter-effect on our revenues, which means the equipment cost, where we have an increase, and you can see in the revenues a similar increase. And also, in the connection cost, particularly in the one related to the international wholesale of Sparkle, we have an increase of these costs, which has, as I said, an immediate reference in the revenues of Sparkle.
 Excluding these two exceptions, which are, of course, perfectly explained by the evolution of revenues, the ratio is stable.",131,No
"I answer the first, and Stefano De Angelis answers the second. Most of the Company knows that I tended to be the chief testing officer, because I tended to use all the services we sell, which is not the best experience for most of my colleagues, but if you don't do so you never know what's happening in real life.
 For the time being, the true answer is, no, on the process. We don't see major, major falls, to be honest, neither minor falls, but it's really very, very early.
 We are very -- we were very optimistic on the possibility to sell Sky on most of our copper lines. And I'm very curious to see, in a couple of months, if my expectation will be confirmed. Because, ultimately, if you consider the real bandwidth need, in order to have a superb HD experience, is something between 7 mega and 8 mega real, if you consider that 65% of our customer base is reached with a nominal 20 mega, now that decrease the nominal 20 mega as down as you want.
 But I think we should be able to offer not only on the fiber, of course, I'm much more happy if the customer buys the fiber and Sky, but in case the area is not reached with fiber, I think that it's not a major limitation, should not be a major limitation for us.
 And then, I leave Stefano to Stefano.",242,Yes
"I'm taking the answer for Giovanni. I don't change my mind. I think that in the capital structure, saving shares are a little bit [aged] as an instrument. It's not a high priority, because the level of inefficiency that it determines on dividend is not that high.
 But, as I told you, if I imagined the Company some time in the future I think that this heavy quantity of saving shares probably is not that actual as it was some years ago when this structure was created. So the real question is not what we think; the real question is when the market conditions it will be appropriate, and market conditions include several aspects. So, I don't change my mind.
 Thank you, Giovanni.",123,No
"Okay, yes, the total domestic revenues, the trend of the total domestic revenues in the fixed is mostly due in this quarter to two effects. One is the re-pricing of the monthly fee, which is positive on consumer, of course.
 But we have to be a bit careful because the trend is very positive on the consumer. The consumer, if we split the fixed revenues between consumer and business, consumer made a sharp increase, up to less than minus 2%; and the business service remained more or less in the minus 6% territory.
 So what we see is that this component coming from the consumer will continue to be maintained. And we assume, for the coming quarters, a recovery also on the business for a long list of actions that we are taking.
 Keep in mind that there is also a wholesale effect, a wholesale effect that is driven mostly by prices. It's EUR9 million that is the quarter effect of the prices on Q1, that goes also down with your margins.
 So I think that if you wanted to give a fixed breakdown, we have in the annexes a full detail of the fixed breakdown that can be extremely helpful in spreading these analyses.
 And Piergiorgio will answer the second part of your question.",215,No
"Well, partly the FOG business was really soft in Q1, and we were still optimistic we could make that back in the back half of the year. We saw a pretty good recovery this quarter sequentially and year-over-year, but it's still a little below where we had expected to be at this point. So we've trimmed the estimates of the FOG business, and that's really the only change in the guidance (inaudible) in terms of our guidance.",77,Yes
"Yes. We did have good growth in the hardware year-over-year, so we are in that low double-digit growth rate for hardware this quarter compared to a year ago. So it is accelerating. It's just that at this point, we don't see the oil and gas recovering. For a while there, our customers tell us it has to be sort of in the $60 to $70 range before that business, the offshore business, recovers. And it looked for a little while like it was moving in that direction, but now it looks like it's going the other way.
 So we're just assuming we won't see any improvement in that part of the business. But I think we are encouraged that we are still able to get net ads and growth rate that's ahead of where we were a year ago, despite what's going on in this one sector. So we are pretty well diversified. So I don't want to give the impression that we are totally focused in oil and gas. Right now, probably 100% or 90% of our growth is in other sectors.",183,Yes
"No. What Peter is talking about is our back-office billing system, which is integrated into the financial system. I think what you're talking about is sort of a pay-per-view or an onboard where the crew pays. And that's done -- a lot of these crew don't actually have credit cards. So the way we handle that is through prepaid cards that we sell to the vessel master.
 So we sell the cards, so it doesn't involve credit cards by the crew onboard. So it's part of our crew link and it's part of a crew calling system that enables them to access the Internet and make phone calls, but it doesn't allow them to purchase content.",116,Yes
"No, we don't have a specific growth rate. We haven't given specific guidance for the airtime revenue growth, but I think that you are right in saying that the current growth rate is less than we had going into the year. And I think we've mentioned a couple times the reason for that is primarily the variable component of metered plans and dayrate business which is used in the oil and gas. And that's really the area, the only area where we've seen any softness.",85,No
"I think almost all the customers are looking at content now. So it's really an important part of the product offering. I think we are seeing that also in the deal we did with Inmarsat where they want to have access to our content like our training product and our news link service. So it's just -- we've really changed the whole basis for competition, and I think now everybody is looking at content services and training as part of the total solution. So they may not all have budgets for it in the current year, but I would say we aren't talking to anybody who says, oh, I'm not interested in that because we don't need it.",118,Yes
"Your question about the level of overall investment in '21 versus '20 and are we able to sustain that. The answer is yes. So we're reinvesting incremental investment in '21 at a very similar level to what we had in '20. And the way that we're able to do that
 (technical difficulty)
 and pulled forward the business optimization and just...",60,Yes
"Yes. Sure, Mark, and thanks for the question. The -- if I refer, as I mentioned, is this being the third wave. We expect this third wave to be a lot like the second wave in the summer. However, it's going to be much more widespread geographically. And that opens up more hospital capacity as a result. We do believe that the -- from what we're hearing from our customers that they feel confident, that they can manage what is anticipated in terms of hospitalizations, their treatment protocols, their ability to segregate patients, their ability to -- the patient profile themselves is a very different patient than the first wave, and it's much more geographically dispersed.
 So I think in the U.S., yes, it's going to provide some tension, but manageable is the current feeling. In Europe, with the spikes that are going on and the surge going on in Europe, the level of ICU capacity in particular and treatment capacity in certain regions of Europe, we are starting to see pressure building. And as a result, some higher level of interest and demand in some of our product offerings as a result. That goes across from ICU offering to our vital signs business to thermometry.
 So we're starting to see some of that in Europe today. But it does seem -- it's -- again, it does seem much more well-managed and not panic-oriented, but we are starting to see some incremental demand in those areas.",246,Yes
"Yes. We have not seen any deliveries yet. Obviously, there's some commentary out there of a pending launch, but we have not seen any deliveries occur at this point in time. So we expect that will happen in the next couple of months, but we've not seen anything material in the marketplace today.",53,Yes
"Yes. I would say, Matt, the COVID benefit of $180 million, you see this quarterly breakdown in that one schedule that I pointed to earlier. 80% of it is beds and half of it, half of the total, was international, the other half was in the U.S. So those are probably 2 good kind of ways to think about that $180 million. 80% beds, 20% ventilators and then 50-50 in total in aggregate between U.S. and international. So that's -- I hope that answers your question. Did you have a follow-on to that?",93,Yes
"Yes, sure. So as I mentioned earlier, emerging markets, we expect double-digit growth. China, we expect very high double-digit growth. Our investments are really starting to come through there. And because of the breakdown I just gave you earlier, that $180 million being roughly half of that being internationally, that was mostly in Canada and Europe. So we will have in that timeframe of Q3 and Q4 some very challenging comps overcome in those regions. So barring some unforeseen demand, which has not into our guidance, we would expect to have some challenges in that Q3 period internationally.",98,No
"Primarily refining. Petchem, I don't think is a problem. Most of those projects are going through. There's still work there to bid. It's just -- it's primarily just in the refining industry. We've seen our Engineering groups have slowed down a little bit on some feeds they were doing in the refining business. I think people, they're primarily just pushing some projects out to wait and see what happens with oil prices and how long it takes for oil -- the price of oil to reach a respectable or reasonable level.",91,Yes
"I think that's a good question. I mean it's going to be interesting to see how -- what companies come out of this healthy and strong. And we're -- and I'm sure there are a number of companies you're going to see probably either go away or be acquired or merged coming out of the smaller companies, for sure. So I think it's -- I think we're going to be in good shape, but I think we have some competitors that are well positioned also. It's going to be interesting to see how everybody else does.",96,No
"And it is so far. It just depends on -- what we're hearing from those clients is not that they're making cuts to their capital spending programs, but that they might if the country doesn't open back up or their respective states don't open up because their biggest consumers of gas are restaurants, bars, hotel services, hotels that have restaurants and bars and that type of industry. So if those demands stay down, they may not have the need. You're not seeing a lot of -- you're seeing drops in new housing and some of those -- so those customers, those new customers that they would have, there won't be that need there. So there'll be reductions there. As far as replacement or maintenance of existing systems or old systems, that work is going to continue.",136,Yes
"Yes. I don't know -- Sean, I don't know if there's any one big swing. I think it's a little bit of everything right now, right? When you got this much going on and potentially this much volatility, it just got to be a point where we looked at all the different models and potential outcomes for the year and the range instead of narrowing for guidance was widening. And so when that occurs, we just decided to pull back on guidance temporarily in order to let another quarter play out. And we're hopeful that by the time we get to announcing Q2 here in late July and early August, we'll be in a position to give you guys guidance again because some of this will settle down, and we'll just have greater clarity.",134,No
"Well, again, I think 2020 is pretty secure. Of course, we got to wait on the big project we're waiting on that I mentioned earlier with respect to the Supreme Court and the ruling on there. But we're -- both of our union and nonunion pipeline groups are busy through the -- towards the end of this year. So it's more so, my concern would be, are we going to have work going into next year? Now if the large project that I referred to earlier goes forward, then Rockford will be busy for the next 1.5 years.",98,No
"Yes. Thanks, Carlos. Well, finally, your third question was coming back to the production cost savings in Europe indicator of the Page 25. If we -- to reach EUR 700 after doing EUR 110, we need, well, EUR 590 this year and this year and next year. And as we were commenting before, the CO2 impact additive content will decrease a lot in 2020 compared to '19. So basically, the synergies that we were seeing in '19 on the purchasing that I've mentioned before with the common platform on high-volume cars were starting in '19, will develop a lot in '20. In '19, it was hidden by the fact that we're adding content. So basically, the answer is in this KPI, and we need to do much more in 2020 compared to '19 but with less CO2 content.",138,Yes
"EBITDA, so we haven't given that number to kind of make it a little bit hard for you in some places. But it will be broadly similar to the kind of EBITDA you've seen in the investment business over recent years. So that business has historically performed at 50% EBITDA margin, plus or minus. But that's not formal guidance, as we've said, that we always said on that is that the EBITDA, in absolute terms, is likely to fall by around about 5% per annum as we marginally shrink the balance sheet and achieve the deleveraging ambitions.",97,No
"Yes. So I think on investment sort of shape, I think a reasonably good working assumption is a straight line from here, so 70% of GBP 1.7 billion is, what, about GBP 1.2 billion. I think a reasonable straight line from -- obviously, bear in mind, that we started investing earlier this year, that sort of first 6 months of the year were relatively slow. We started to accelerate into the second half. We should go on a reasonable straight line from here through to, I guess, full investment, we'll kind of run through to late '22. By the time we can get to the next fund raise, we said sometime in half 1. And we'd hope to be able to sort of run -- to run straight out ACO 1 into ACO 2 from an investing perspective.",138,Yes
"So look, we -- I -- the data on the chart, there's a chart in the middle of that slide that talks to the potential performance fees that we might generate. And you can see that on a 13% return, which is our targeted return, it will generate somewhere around about GBP 130 million of carry with about, as we said, 30% to 40% of that flowing to the PLC. The NPV of that, I guess, in cash terms, most of that will be back-ended. Most of that will flow in, in the last 2 or 3 years of the fund. As we've shown on the slide, we will recognize that from an accounting perspective a little bit earlier than that, broadly speaking, a couple of years earlier than it gets recognized in cash terms. The NPV, I guess, is a function of what discount rate you want to apply to that. But I guess you can do the sums from there.",162,No
"Shall I take that? I mean, I think Matt set out very clearly, Gary -- sorry, thanks the question. Matt set out very clearly, our approach to capital allocation and share buybacks, just another form of return to investor, I think that you should think of within that framework. Our first priority, to be really clear is to get our leverage down to the levels that we've set out in the presentation today. We're confident we can get there. We're confident we can get there on the timing that we talked to you about. And it's only then that we'll start to think about other priorities for use of capital.
 I believe if we deliver the plan we are talking about with the targets we're talking about and particularly the sort of reductions in net debt that the share price will follow and that there's substantial upside there to the share price in today's values. But clearly, one of the things we will look at versus alternative deployment, whether that's continue to invest, paying dividends, share buybacks, will be the value we see in the share price. So it's not on the immediate horizon. But it will fit very firmly within the framework that we've set out today.",208,No
"Yes, I was struggling a bit here. But I think it was about kind of the rate that we're setting. So the rates are kind of an arm's length market reference rate. So they're not -- they're broadly similar in many cases, identical to the ones we are charging external third parties. But they are referenced to a benchmarked index that the fund independently procures in order to make sure that they are paying a fair fee. I think that was the question.",83,Yes
"Okay. Good. Thank you very much for joining us today on this conference call this morning. I would like to invite you to attend our virtual AGM at 11:00 today. We have a good presentation for the shareholders that I think we do a good summary. We try to have more presentations. And the login information is available on our website at stingray.com. And also, as you know, the AGM will be recorded, so looking forward to speaking to all of you soon. And let's all stay safe. Thank you, everybody (foreign language). Bye, guys.",95,No
"Our ARPU, yes. So B2C that's about $15 average ARPU. B2B is at $6. And when we do mobile, it's at $1.50 to $2. When we do deal in Mexico, the ARPU is also smaller in Mexico because of the way we do it in the pesos. So -- but generally, we feel comfortable that our average ARPU should be around $8.",62,Yes
"Yes. So we've been -- on the M&amp;A side, we've been -- with COVID, more difficult to meet your potential partners. Takes longer times. That's 1 negative. Usually, they come see our office. We give them the Kool-Aid, and there's a bit of relationship built. But so for sure, now it takes more time on the phone and Zoom. We are very, very, very disciplined. The upfront deals, we're looking out between 3 and 4. We tell our partners we're between 3 and 4x cash upfront, so there's no real impact on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And so we have a strong pipeline, probably have 4 or 5 LOIs right now that we're working on. So we're very -- and we feel that we're ready starting probably in September to pull the trigger. For sure, for the last 4 or 5 months, we are a bit more worried about pulling the trigger. But I think now we're down that path. So we're happy to -- I think we're going to see a few deals close before the holidays. That will be tuck-in, but it will be very strategic.
 Yes, I think that was the last question.",195,No
"Yes. So roughly for Q2, because we're already halfway into it, we're going to be in the 40s. So we're still going to be negative. So I say 40%, it could be minus 42%, I can't tell you, but we're going to be in the 40s, could be 45s. In Q3, we're -- hopefully, we'll be back in the 20s. And hopefully, by the end of the year, we'll be back at 0. Right now, for the last couple of weeks, we've been hitting about 80% of the sales flow of last year. So we're selling at 80% of last year. Direct correlation with the stores opening up. So when the stores are opening up, then our sales go per city. The last city that we were down was Toronto, but now Toronto has opened up. So -- but again, all this is where 0 -- or this -- if there's a second closure of stores in the fall because then we'll go back down to what number of stores are closed. So this is based on the fact that stores remain open, there's no second closure. So I just want to put a big asterisk on that. So in the 40s this quarter, in the 20s, and then we should be back to 0 by the end of the year.",221,No
"So subsidies, $9 million, $1 million was for Q4. Reduction in costs, $7.5 million per quarter. We estimate 1/3 of that is going to be recurring $10 million. So when you do your models, you can take out $10 million of OpEx. And we should expect another $8 million of wage subsidies for Q2.",54,No
"So, we don't have the exact details here. Let me say it was a good mix of both. So, it wasn't dominated by either ATCA or media server. Whether it's 50-50, I don't know, but it was a good mix of both products.
  So both have just done extremely well over the last two years in terms of going out and competing and winning business out there. So competitively, I continue to like our position quite a bit on both products.",81,Yes
"So if we're thinking about the same one, not a lot of visibility into what will happen. I think our expectation is the wins that we have there are pretty solid and moving along pretty well. We believe we have technically superior product.
  So, I think overall we feel in a good position, and this may even open up some new opportunities for us down the road.",67,Yes
"Yes. In the second half of the year last year, we made really nice progress from a marketing perspective. So if you go to our website, there's a lot of good collateral there.
  We've got our sales team equipped for the last quarter or two, lined up a number of partners, and the funnel is growing really nicely in the defense space. That being said, as long as telecommunications is, defense might be a little bit longer in terms of the design cycle, but there are some pretty meaty programs out there that we believe ATCA is well suitable for.
  So, a couple of quarters into it, I'm pretty happy with the progress of the team, and it's an area that we're committed to, and we think we bring a lot of value and core competence for defense customers.
  So, Christie?",141,Yes
"So the 20% to 30% decline principally is in our legacy wireless business, which is principally NSN. We are seeing a share shift from legacy products to new ATCA-based products there. Included in the number is also commercial, and I think for commercial, that business is holding up relatively well for us.
  So principally, it's in the next-gen sort of custom CPU designs that we'd done a number of years ago. And I don't think there is a principle shift relative to what we've been thinking before. But I think this year is an important demarcation point from us as our new revenues eclipse the old revenues.",107,Yes
"We don't have a set timeline. We are still very happy with the flow of ideas that we have and ways that we can strategically grow the business. So I think until we get to the point of saying, boy, there's not a lot on the horizon for us to look at, that would make sense to grow the Company, I think we're going to keep pressing forward with what is a pretty interesting set of strategic growth opportunities, make sure we continue to do a good job diligencing those, and find things that will add well to the Company.
  So, no set timeline, but if we run into exhaust at some point, I imagine that might be possible.",119,No
"There is two elements to that. Luckily English is very much the lingua franca of the internet. When we're dealing with a customer, it is overwhelmingly likely that they kind of grew up in and around the internet and have a working knowledge of English so that we're able to conduct business. That being said, our people on the ground in Europe, I want to say cover between six and eight languages between them, and certainly when, again, as we're dealing in certain parts of Asia, language, you really do need that, but at an interface level where the one place where that manifests itself is web mail. When we're selling our email product, our hosted email service, if somebody is providing it to their end-users, we do have to provide a translated version. It is a tad limiting. So I think now we cover somewhere again between eight or nine different languages with our web mail interface, and that's something that we tend to expand on a sort of as-needed basis, based on customer demand.",176,Yes
"Yes I don't really -- we might have one company that I would say we're watching more and we're -- basically we're trying to do a landlord renegotiation, because it can't -- it's not using all of the space. Depending on how that goes, we might put some more cap on, we might not, et cetera. That's more ordinary course. I don't think there's anything -- we have most of the recession related restructuring issues behind us. We feel pretty good about what we have.
 And, frankly, with the merger and the follow-on offering and everything else, we haven't really done the cash balances at the portfolio company level. I will tell you that they're probably higher than they've been just because the portfolio -- we've had several portfolio companies that have elected to accumulate cash rather than delever, just because there's still some uncertainty out there, and -- but that -- we will calculate that and get back with you.",161,No
"Let me hit the first part of that, and then Todd will give you the cash balance number. The one issue you have with the SBIC funds is what I would call a cash geography issue. You have to overinvest cash down in those funds, and those -- the cash -- there are pretty severe restrictions with respect to how that cash can be invested. I think just treasuries and CDs, so you're really not earning anything on that. And when you're BDC like we are, SBA has more restrictive rules in terms of when and how you fund the equity component in those funds' capitalizations.
 It basically, simplistically, you have to pre-fund your equity in those funds before you can leverage that equity with SBA guaranteed debentures. Whereas if you weren't a BDC, you could obtain leverage with the security -- a future equity contributions or limited partner draws. You can't really do that so when we bought the second fund into the fold, we had to go ahead, and from our parent company, transfer $24 million down into that subsidiary. It left us with -- while we had plenty of cash overall in the consolidated balance sheet, it left us with a shortfall at the parent company. That's really what we needed to replenish. It was really what I would call more of a geography issue on the balance sheet.",232,No
"I think it's around $80 million currently and that includes marketable securities. We're obviously trying to earn a yield on that cash while we have it. But beyond some of the geography of cash mechanics that Vince just talked about, we are seeing a lot of opportunities to invest in the market. There certainly was an exchange offer element of the offering, but we're also positioning ourselves to take advantage of what we think will be a strong origination market in 2010 and beyond.",84,No
"I think, specifically, Vernon, the industries that you would probably expect, we're seeing revenue growth in. Some of the energy end markets are picking up. There's a lot going on in the Marcellus shale, which we have a relative concentration in the Gulf Coast, and things are picking up there. Some of the more defensive industries that we are in, like health care, are continuing to do well and training, that type of thing. We don't see a lot of meaningful pickup in our basic industrial services type sectors.",89,Yes
"What we're seeing, Vernon, is that -- the first piece of that comment was that we're seeing stabilization pretty much across the portfolio. We still have a couple of companies, the signed company in Vegas is a good example, where we're starting to see stabilization, but it's at a pretty low level. Most of our companies are still at reasonable levels of earnings and revenues and starting to see stabilization. Again, there's a handful or more of companies where we're starting to see order flow and backlog and those types of forward indicators really pick up, and some of that is end market specific. But I think in general, we're feeling a lot more bullish about where the companies are headed over the last quarter or so than we were earlier in 2009.",133,Yes
"Yes. I mean it's not precise as far as the second half, Carter. The second half, depending on where the fault volumes and originations come in the third quarter, we would expect a little bit of a pickup on margins, so that will carry us. Originally, our guidance improved a second to third quarter step-up. Now we see second quarter to third quarter flat, maybe up a little bit. And then fourth quarter looking more like the first. So there's really no precision around -- it's a marginal change in EBITDA from the first half to the second half.",99,No
"Let me -- it's a long question, Matt. Let me try to address the issues you brought up. From a fit and focus standpoint, we believe these businesses are better with somebody who can make the investments, because we are focused on improving our data and analytics position, as we have said in the past. In terms of generating interest out there, we have seen a fair amount of interest. If you really look at the competitive picture out there, there were four people in the tier one [Alltegrity and Crow], Lexus, Nexus and ourselves. Alltegrity and Crow combining it, they have scored a lot of interest in the marketplace that there is only a few companies that if anybody wants to create an enterprise in the background screening can get to. And we provide the best platform, in terms of a global presence, especially with the big presence we have in Asia-Pac. So the attraction is there, but I would like to underscore the fact that we do like the businesses. It's a question of fit and focus. If we do not find the right value, we're not going to settle for -- this is not a fire sale.",200,Yes
"It's hard to understand the way the origination data came out for the second quarter, because it was a pretty big spread between Freddy, Fanny and the MBA. And one of the things that we're seeing is that -- depending on which data that you look at, the large originators are not having as much traction as the smaller guys right now as far as the originations first quarter to second quarter. Our numbers are more tracking the smaller guys in most of the businesses -- the larger guys in most of our origination businesses, except for flood, which has a more diversified client base. They're on the lender side, sequential volumes are up 17% , and again, on the PNC side we're up 31% sequentially on flood concerns. So we're seeing sort of a smaller really increase to the large guys compared to the",145,Yes
"That's why, Matt, we're pleased in the quarter. We got placed on a couple of platforms on the R.E.O. side, and we're going to continue that focus in the third quarter and the balance of the year, so that eventually when the inventory flows through, we're in a very good position to profit from a revenue standpoint.",57,Yes
"We think it's just a matter of time. The amount of business that's going to flush through, is still there and growing, and we'll see. And we also make money over the entire span of the default spectrum, not just on the front end, but the back end. So during this period of time, we're still in a position to generate good revenues, but I think growth will come as we flush through all of the shadow inventory.",78,Yes
"Sure. I mean I think, Mickey, what you're referencing is really the challenging aspect of the primary new issuance market for CLO equity and CLO structures overall, which we agree with. Deep has been talking about this for some time. He has spoken at some conferences about this, and we agree. New issue equity generically is a challenging asset class. We have participated in some new issues, but most of our activity really over the course of the last year, 1.5 years has been in the secondary market where we see better opportunities.",93,Yes
"Sure, Mickey. You'll note that Oxford Lane, unlike Oxford Square, had a considerable volume of new purchases during the quarter. The 2 companies are affiliates by virtue of common managements -- management teams and affiliated advisors. So that was really -- the biggest issue for Oxford Lane, Mickey, was that we did a substantial amount of portfolio turnover during the quarter. And as a result, you saw that rise in effective yield.
 One thing that's also worth noting is that if you look at Page 5 of the investor presentation that was posted to the website this morning, you'll see that we're currently, which is as of June 30, carrying $102.3 million worth of noncash income-producing CLO equity. This is CLO equity that we've purchased, but which has yet to make its inaugural distribution to us as an owner. $55.6 million of that is expected to make initial distribution by 9/30, and $46.7 million is expected to make its inaugural distribution to us by December 31, 2019.",167,Yes
"Yes, no problem, Shane. So when we look at the relationship between revenue and direct costs, those 2 will move depending on the different arrangements we have with practitioners. So that's being impacted by -- we talked about Everything Dentures coming to business previously, so the different arrangements that we have with their procedures, the lab fees that are coming in. And also, we see a seasonal impact around December with the impact of [Logan's] coming in to support the higher volumes we see that are coming in December. So they have a different arrangement and those arrangements just determine where there's a mix between the revenue and direct costs. So that's been the driver that we've seen in this half.",121,Yes
"Yes. Thanks, Tanu. So when -- what we've done with this graph is really focused on the centers that have been part of the rollout plan in recent times. So previously, we had included centers from FY '11 that were probably a different footprint, a bit larger centers. So we focused on the centers that have rolled out. Obviously, there's going to be differences in costs. Also if you look, we have called out and previously discussed the fact that in recent times, we haven't seen fees increasing, so we haven't seen the health funds increasing their fees that come through to us. So that will also have an impact on how new centers ramp compared to centers from, say, year 2011 that were previously disclosed in here that would've had those sort of fee increases in. So they're some of the key factors, but I wouldn't read anything too much into it. I mean, we're happy with how these new centers have ramped. We think this cohort and the way we're reporting for it into '18 is more reflective and provides better information.",184,No
"I mean, we've always said that, Tanu, that the margin expansion and the impact of that mix will vary depending whether you open more or less centers. So if we opened 15, the impact of that mix would actually drag down your average growth across all the centers. If we open less over a period of time, yes, that would change that mix. So that's nothing different from what we've talked about previously.",73,Yes
"Yes, Tanu. So Phil talked about there's the mix issues that we see and there's lots of factors that contribute. What we are expecting is that there will be some pressure around fees that we see from health funds coming through in the second half of the year and that will be another factor, which is why we've downgraded to that 5% EBITDA growth.",64,No
"Mike, we're not some -- it depends if you're -- we're not saying in the half, what we're saying is that the half was impacted by 2 key adverse impacts that we were talking about. We saw the fees decline, we saw the telecommunication costs higher than we expected. I mean, those 2 items had a fairly significant impact in our EBITDA growth. Half-and-half would have been significantly higher if those 2 factors weren't contributors. So that's sort of the 1 main factor. I mean, every and -- but every rollout centers, whether we accelerate, decelerate, whether it's 10, 15 or 5, that will have an impact on that margin mix of the centers depending on the profile of where they are in their life cycle.",126,No
"Thank you, operator. We appreciate everyone taking the time today to join us. As operator mentioned, if there were any questions we did not address today, please contact our IR team. You can find their full contact information at the bottom of today's earnings release.
 As always, we'll keep you informed as we go forward. In early September, we will be in San Francisco at the eighth annual Gateway Conference. At the end of October, we'll be at the Dawson James Conference in Florida. So we look forward to driving the business forward and to continuing to keep you all informed as we make progress. Thanks again, and have a great evening.",112,No
"Yes, thank you, Christian. Great question. And as Mark indicated in his remarks, we are in the process of raising the working capital necessary to run operations to get to cash flow breakeven. Our Board has -- is pursuing that, and we've raised $285,000 in recent weeks and are continuing to pursue that. We are confident we will have the cash to fund our way to cash flow breakeven.",69,No
"Thanks, Karl, and thanks to each of you for your time and continued support as we move closer to more meaningful commercialization of our powerful SDC antimicrobial. I look forward to reporting back to you with our continuing progress on our next call. Thanks, and have a great rest of your day.",52,Yes
"Okay. Thanks, [Gloria]. I'll take the first one. As we've indicated in previous calls, with regard to online reprocessing, we had some stops and starts with trials on that. We did not get to the point where we were as successful as we expected to be, and there were some cost issues involved with that as well. What we shifted our focus to was testing on parts, pre-online reprocessing and then post-emergent chiller, and we have done a lot of testing on parts. We continue to look at testing on parts, but to be honest, over the past several months, we've had our limited sales and technical services resources really focused on our closest in opportunities, especially our produce processors and food transportation solution.
 On poultry, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are focused on the front end of the supply chain in hatcheries, and we are also working with 2 strategic distributors who have specific expertise in poultry processing and distributing processing aids to poultry processors. We're working with them on a strategic arrangement where we could -- they would augment our efforts because our resources are stretched very thin right now with produce and food transportation. So we know there's an opportunity with parts, and we're bringing more resources to bear against that as we work with these strategic distributors.
 I'll now turn it over to Tom to answer the question about misting in high freezer areas.",241,Yes
"(foreign language) So I'll answer your first question. In terms of the total enrollment released last year, the gross number was 13,735 that's in my data book, maybe slightly different from the earnings release, you can refer back. So the breakdown shall be 8,352 students for our regular courses in our self-owned learning centers and 685 students are online students and 4,698 students for the short-term courses. And there is no student enrollment for Edge second quarter of last year.",80,Yes
"Felix, let me address your question on sales and marketing and administrative costs. I think for sales and marketing expenses, as we have explained in our first quarter earnings release, the margin impact will be around 1% as compared to last year. As of now, we are in very good control of expenses for developing new marketing channels as well as the control over the personnel costs in the sales and marketing team. So that is entirely in line with our expectations. There's a pretty dramatic increase in the administrative cost. It's primarily due to a grant of new option scheme in the second quarter. So the total noncash stock option-based compensation amounts to RMB 27 million in the second quarter. So if you take a close look at the change of our general and administrative costs in the second quarter, which was RMB 92 million as compared to RMB 55 million last year, it's an increase of RMB 37 million. So RMB 27 million is the stock option related expenses and RMB 10 million is actually the result of the increase in our professional fees, the fees paid to developing our blueprint and also professional fees in association with our acquisition initiatives. So the increase in the professional fees will be a onetime hit in the second quarter.",219,No
"Thank you, Alex, for your question. On the Shijiazhuang, our auditors is still in the final stage of reviewing their accounts. As a private company, there are lots of things to do in order to address some compliance issues such as social security, taxes that need to be paid and also tax payable to the government. So in terms of the top line, we would expect for the second half of this year it's likely to be roughly 1.5% of contribution to our top line for the second half of this year.",92,Yes
"Well, I think that there are probably 2 trends that are going on. One is that we have increased our focus on technologies, customer responsiveness and just our physical presence in order to drive volumes, and that is something that we articulated as a part of our 3-year growth program in April. So I think that our buying initiatives have definitely taken hold the interaction within the Pick-n-Pull operation and our recycling unit has given us significant traction. And so I think that, that has driven a big portion of that supply flow. I think the macro trend that we're seeing is that as you see the new car sales volumes -- you see the dealers being much more aggressive in selling new cars. And that trickles down into the used car markets. And when you look then at the average age of vehicles on the road, which is really at its peak, about 12 years, over 100,000 miles. The more aggressive pricing of used car vehicles is encouraging those people who are driving what is close to an end-of-life vehicle to trade up and that is pushing more end-of-life vehicles into the supply chain. So I think you've got 2 things, one of which we drove and one of which is a bit of a tailwind or breeze, if you will, at our back in terms of increasing supply flows.",231,Yes
"I think it depends upon the area and how impacted it is. So in places like Houston, I'm not sure that they've seen significant flows at this point. In Puerto Rico, where we have operations, we also haven't seen any significant impact right now. And I think in all of those cases, it will be relatively short-lived and won't affect national flows so I'm not sure at the end of the day, you're going to see a significant national impact.",80,No
"It will be 25% throughout the year based on our estimate because the way we account for taxes, you look at your projected full year rate and then you use that projection for each quarter throughout the year, and it only changes as your projection for your full year changes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So 25% for each quarter based on our outlook guidance today but we will provide an update each quarter and throughout the year.",77,No
"Yes, Phil. It's Richard here. Good morning. As you know, we're aiming to grow our overall company-wide ferrous volumes by 30% over a 3-year period to fiscal '19. We achieved a 10% growth in fiscal '17, so we're on track with that 3-year objective and it's certainly our aim to continue that throughout fiscal '18, consistent with our first quarter outlook on ferrous volumes.",64,Yes
"We have put the -- we have triggered the MVNO with Verizon, and we're now working through the process of creating a business plan and some test processes that we plan to work through in this year to be ready to launch broadly next year. That isn't to say we wouldn't have any commercial activity this year, but to integrate a wireless business into a high volume transaction business that we already have is the major challenge.
 Now, we also have to enter into contracts with instrument providers and billing systems, and we have to consider our store front capability. We have 700 stores in the new company. Is that enough? Where should we be, from a retail perspective?
 And so we're still working through all of those issues. So in order to actually do it at a relatively small scale is pretty easy. The issue is, how do you do it at massive scale quickly?",156,No
"On rate increases, the goal here really was much more around standardization for things like the broadcast surcharge, and whatnot. So it wasn't about significant rate increases. Relative to the total amount of rate increase that was in 2016, what's in 2017 is really a small fraction of what it was in the prior year. And that's what I was trying to convey through the comments.
 The goal here is to drive customer relationship growth, and to drive high-quality growth. And if you look at legacy Charter, we're growing customer relationship growth at about 6%. We're growing residential revenue at around 6%. We think that's the right way, if you can go get it, to drive growth. And if you have pricing power today, it means that you are pricing power in the future. Our goal is to grow it now and to grow fast, and to create momentum in the marketplace.",152,No
"Sure. Look, we had a lot of headwinds in the previous administration, from a regulatory point of view, we got Title II. It didn't really affect us but had the potential of affecting us. I think that there's a good probability that could be reversed, which would be a good thing for us.
 We were prepared to live in that world, so it's better to live in a world where you have more visibility into your investments, and how they might be regulated in the future. The set top box issue was really about Google and other companies getting access to video content without paying for it, and that appears to not be an issue going forward. And so the general proposition for a better FCC has already manifested itself in the appointment of Ajit Pai as Chairman of the FCC, and the processes that he's reforming and reviewing all look to be better for us than the previous regime.",160,No
"I'll answer the last one. We think 5G-like products doesn't necessarily require fiber in every location. It requires a high capacity interconnection between the cells, and that can be wireless too, it can be fiber, and it can be coax. But it's a high capacity inter-cell connection, if that's what you mean by backhaul. And it can be -- there's more than one way to do it.",67,Yes
"Jason, from a financial perspective, just so it's clear to those thinking about the CapEx implications, we've been doing virtual and physical node splits for years. We continue to do it. And we've been going, particularly at TWC and even at Bright House for new builds and now at legacy Charter, new build with fiber to the premise. The things Tom is talking about are already in the numbers, and it's the type of activity we did today, and the boxes, we're actually buying with those IP capabilities at cheaper prices.",91,No
"And it's probably worth mentioning, in the Americas, we have 2 very talented new executives. One is John Auerbach, who oversees the Art &amp; Objects group. And the other -- and he's not here at the earnings call today. But the other, of course, is Val Carlotti. Among Val's many responsibilities is the Art &amp; Objects group. Val joined us from Goldman Sachs, and actually, this is day 4 for him. So I probably won't cold call him here in this earnings call. He's thanking me for that. But maybe we'll get him on the next call in middle market.",100,No
"Sure, sure. A lot of detail still needs to be hammered out and the Senate has to do its thing, and then they have to reconcile and all that. But I think thematically, we will be a net beneficiary from what's being discussed in 2 respects. First, if corporate rate in the United States goes from 35% to 20%, it is factually correct that the corporate tax rate on U.S. earnings is higher than all of the other geographies in which we generate earnings. And remember, we're a global company, so we generate a lot of money in Hong Kong, in Switzerland, in the U.K., all of which have high -- lower marginal rates than the United States. So 20% will benefit us in our tax rate for sure. And then the second place where we will benefit is in the onetime repatriation of cash that we have decided to keep offshore. And it looks like there's going to be some holiday, if you will, where we would be able to bring that back at an even lower rate, something like 12%, as what's being discussed. So in both of those respects, I think as a corporate entity, we're in a pretty good shape. Adam, let's talk about the clients?",210,No
"So Oliver, we don't really want to share more than we did in terms of the underlying stats than we did. And we don't really want to say much more about the sell-through rates than we did. However, I'd love to use the opportunity to give you a perspective. We've got Amy Cappellazzo here on the marketplace and how she sees major trends in the buyers at a high level and what she's seeing and how the market is changing. And I don't think her anecdotal answers will be materially different from the statistics you otherwise asked for and we probably aren't going to give you. So Amy?",108,No
"Very interesting question. Well, I'll give you my observation, and then I think we'll pass it over again to Allan and Amy and give you their perspective as well because they are closer to the market than I. And I would say a year ago, the conversations were fraught with significantly more uncertainty. And the sense was when you think about it that we either had just had Trump elected or he was just about to be elected and we thought he would not be elected. And so depending on which date -- the answer is going to slightly change by and which date you were 1 year ago. I don't -- I just don't remember what 1 year was, but let's...",122,No
"Yes. well, of course, it's important to see that with private sales, they ebb and flow, depending on the size of the transaction in a particular quarter. It's also important to see that, and we said this 3 or 4 quarters ago, that a critical component to strong secular growth on that is the object database, and we don't anticipate that coming online until the first quarter of 2018, which I think is consistent largely with what I said the last time we talked about it. So from our perspective, what you're seeing now is enhanced energy, focus, some terrific new talents. It's been there and making some good progress, but it's still in my mind early days on the private sale opportunity. Adam, maybe want to add anything?",129,Yes
"That is one of the reason -- the continuing resolution is one of the reasons why we haven't seen a pickup in infrastructure activity, because it maintained funding at the previous levels and just introduced some uncertainty which has caused some delays in project work at the state and local level. So it's unfortunate where the funds -- the increased funding was approved, it was appropriated, just hasn't gone to work yet due to these budget issues. So that -- and that's one of the reasons for our optimism later in the year where the higher funding would begin to go to work and have an impact. And then, once this year's resolution is resolved, they're going to have to go to work pretty quickly on our resolution for 2018, which should provide for an additional increase as provided for under the act.",143,No
"No. I mean, I think underlying level of demand would pretty closely match up with the spending statistics that we see in the private sector of nonresidential construction and the public sector, with the public sector continuing to drag at flat or even slightly lower spending levels and the private side being better. When you roll all of that together, I wouldn't think that it's more than a mid-single digit, high single-digit market growth expectation.",75,No
"Well, it's a phenomenon that we've been living with for the last several years, particularly following, I think it was the 2010 dumping case that the domestic wire rod producers filed and won against China. China has been the worst perpetrator in the world market of pushing dumped and subsidized wire rod. And when that product was shut out of the U.S., it went literally into every other market worldwide, and we think contending with PC strand imports that are produced from China using wire rod from many countries. So it's a phenomenon that we're living with, Chris, and I don't expect it to change, neither to get significantly worse or to improve.",113,Yes
"No. I would say that we haven't seen a significant pickup at this point, but the outlook is positive just considering some of the recent funding measures that have been approved providing for increased spending in certain markets, particularly Texas. The outlook there is real positive and then you are probably familiar with the funding increase that was recently approved out in California -- SB1 -- that provides for a substantial increase over a 10-year period. That obviously hasn't had an impact yet, but I think the outlook there is positive as well. And then there are a number of other states that have implemented fuel tax increases or other fee increases that should have a favorable impact as well, but I would say at this point, we really haven't seen the upside from those.",135,No
"I think that's a legitimate number. We -- this year we ran about 38% or, I believe 38.5% when it was finally wrapped. And then, next year, or this coming year we have six months of being in the Navy Yard, with the improved tax structure there. So, we should be able to get to 38% for the full-year. Although, remember, we probably will not correct that until fourth quarter, so we'll probably use the current tax rate for the first three quarters, and then true it up in the fourth quarter after we do all of the analysis.",99,No
"From the expense side, Kimberly, the opportunities are in the -- the store payroll reflects that pretty consistently as we did this last year based on our sales trend. The other opportunity is that we just converted our distribution center, or fulfillment center in South Carolina to Urban now is on our [TillTrays] order package, . And in the first day that they went live on the [TillTray], they processed the same number of orders as they had the previous day but with 40 less people. So you can kind of do the math on that. It's going to have substantial impact on the -- on this year's SG&amp;A.",109,Yes
"No, I think the issue is that the answer as you highlighted from a factual standpoint that our list pricing is actually substantially cheaper than of some our competitor's products. That being said, on some individual particular deals, that won't matter. As you'll see in general, list pricing is not as much of a factor in the content filtering market as it is in a lot of other markets. A lot of cases, on a deal by deal basis, the pricing that's going to be required in that space is dictated particular to the situation. 
 Although I don't think it is a broad-based phenomenon and in general we don't--we're not going to have to discount in all of these different deals, but there is enough of them that we have to be conscious of how we manage that discounting so that we don't create issues for us on the revenue recognition front. We have done that very well over the last year. We've been very disciplined and basically complete control of what discounting we do in order to maintain and protect the revenue recognition in our current core products.",189,Yes
"On the government deals, we had a couple of different deals. We did not lose them to competitors, it was mainly an issue around budget release on the federal government procurement cycles. So we do expect to ultimately close that business. It is a little bit hard to predict exactly when we should close that business so I can't give you a good, accurate prediction of when that business is going to close, but we did not lose it to competitors.",81,No
"I think our bigger challenges, we've got increasingly better at being able to displace our competitor's products. We invest a lot in material as well as programs and processes around doing that. But I think we're starting to run up against a ceiling of just customers existing depreciation cycles on equipment they purchased from our competitors in the last couple of years and they're not going to--I think we're going to win a lot of that business but we're not going to win it based on the cycle of that depreciation until it has been fully depreciated, most of those customer environments, I think we had a burst over the last year where customers had fully depreciated a lot of that kit and we drove out of that, but fundamentally, I think we're starting to run into those limitations an how rapidly we can turn out existing competitor's products and customer's environments.",152,Yes
"I think you'll start to see some contribution in fiscal Q1. I think it will get to be a much larger impact in fiscal Q2. My view hasn't changed that much in the last couple of months. Progress that we're seeing there looks to be very good. Our competitive analysis as well as understanding the features and the performance benefits we bring, all look pretty good right now.",68,Yes
"I don't think we have a changed view there. Obviously when we fell short on the revenue--as your operating through the quarter, you're expecting to hit that revenue. You build out a certain level of expense profile. It will take a bit for us to correct on that. As we grow revenue again, as we start pushing into these new markets, I would expect to be pushing back to that higher operating margin that we talked about in the Analyst Day. I don't see anything that's going to prevent us from getting there.",93,No
"Well, I can assure you that the Greek government will be very happy to do that. Of course, if they can do it. We are very closely monitoring the situation right now in the United States. Where, you might know that, there is a legislation pending in Washington where they are trying to do the same thing with the Italians. And, not only that, they are not only trying to block some of the sites that, offer illegal betting in the United States. But they are moving further, in trying to block a charging in credit cards of these illegal activities.
 We want to see how this will evolve in the United States. At the same time, we are lobbying in Brussels. And we are looking in ways to go to the Government, and present a very solid proposition of how they could interfere, as government, to block this illegal activity. We will have some news on that in the next two or three months, because we were told that Washington will have finished with this legislation, either positively or negatively, in the next two months.",186,No
"Yes, we have both the numbers and time-frame. We were always saying that it's not going to be a very big game. It is more an amusement game than a gambling one. And don't forget that, we need some time to train the Greek people to play the game. The game is totally unknown in Greece.
 The numbers are going to be limited in the first six months. But we estimate to will build it up slowly. And arrive at a number, which is close to our other games, excluding KINO and Stihima.
 Concerning the time-frame, we are on track, and we expect to launch before the end of this year.",111,Yes
"It was a special event and I assure you that the coupon of OPAP, during the World Cup, it was one of the most attractive coupons in Europe. I remind you that it did not contain only the World Cup we’ve also betting options under/over, live betting, penalties, red cards etc. But it also included Wimbledon games, the World Championship of Motorcycles, the Formula One in Indianapolis and many others. And I assure you that the number that you read, that OPAP made, of more than €420m in one month, was a result of this attractive coupon.",97,Yes
"Well, there is a large amount of preparation that has been done already. And, don't forget, we don't start from zero. We are totally monitoring this game for seven years right now. We have staff in OPAP that is very experienced, that knows how lotteries operate, knows the mentality of the Greek players, they know the game. We are not starting from zero. We will follow up an operation.
 And, as I said, we will be charged in the two years' period. We cannot be very efficient in the first two or three or six months, but we will definitely have good results in -– if we are just in a two-year period. That's our feeling.",116,No
"The payout in the second quarter was exceeding 70%. However, up to now, for the period starting from January 2005 to June 30, we have been close to 66%. That leaves us with an option of having 66% payout for the rest of the year.
 However there is one more issue, which has to be considered. Within the payout, is also containing includes the uncollected winning, which could amount up to €15m, €20m, which is around 1% for this year. Therefore, odds cannot be worsening in the rest of the year, not only because we have not exceeded targeted payout percentage, but also, because we have the custom, the [inaudible] of 1% of uncollected winning. Therefore, we do not expect to have any worsening in the attractiveness of our coupon.",130,Yes
"Excuse me, sorry. Frog in my throat. Just in the Corporate Center numbers for this quarter, there's a few unusual items. And you're directionally getting right, in the sense that we had some losses related to interest rate swaps used to hedge the interest rate risk in our Business Banking mortgage book and deposit book. 
 Now, the issue about that is that a vast bulk of the hedging activity goes into a cash flow model and that's fine. The piece that can't go in there, we have the situation where we have to mark-to-market the interest rate swaps, whilst clearly we can't mark-to-market the mortgages, etc., because they're on an accrual basis. So that was a swing factor of some significance in the quarter but over time, of course, normalizes out to zero. 
 There were also a few numbers in Corporate Center related to our foreign exchange option hedging strategy, which had a swing quarter-to-quarter of some CHF43m as well. Clearly, when we try and hedge out the tail risks in terms of foreign exchange movements and we saw obviously movements in the dollar during this quarter, which resulted in losses into the Corporate Center. 
 We had also some cash flow hedge in effectiveness, which was another CHF37m swing in the quarter as well, and a little bit related to the property write-down in New Jersey as well. So, clearly, we would not expect those to be recurring items in toto going forward.",243,No
"Fourth quarter, first quarter? Well, as we have indicated in our outlook statement, we have seen clearly positive sentiments. We had a good start. We do see full pipelines on the Investment Banking side and we continue to see substantial liquidity and good [peer rates] on the investment side. So that's why we feel comfortable in expecting another record year in terms of both financial results as well as overall performance for UBS Group. 
 Any other questions?",77,No
"Right. The hottest area at this stage is clearly Asia Pacific, where there is clearly a war for talent. And I guess it's fair to say that so far we have been successful in attracting the necessary talent to grow our business. We will, in the future, look more for unconventional sources, meaning people who have basic intrinsic skills for being successful but that may need some additional training, so we have recently established -- or launched the establishment of a resource center, of a campus in Singapore to train certified private wealth managers. 
 I guess, why can we attract them maybe better than others? It's relatively simple. We are a global leader and therefore I think, together with the brand positioning, we have financial advisors which are enough -- find it relatively easy to convince their clients then to follow. And I think that's, at the end, the most important argument for a financial advisor who is considering to change employer. He wants to go to a platform that has the capability, the breadth, the commitment of the institution, the scale and the brand positioning to be enabled to convince his clients to follow. I think that's probably at the heart of what makes us successful and what will continue -- will remain making us successful in attracting these corporate resources.",222,No
"Yes. It's a question we feel, even internally, relatively hard to answer, because there is a lot of blurring areas between client-driven exposures and direct proportional -- and direct proprietary bets. I guess an order of magnitude is maybe 15 to 20% in terms of proprietary results in FIRC but, as I said, it is relatively difficult to exactly define the lines. 
 Strategically, it's very clear that all the growth initiatives we're making, we invest into strengthening client businesses, client franchises, that may well embody requirements to take positions, either on behalf of clients or together with clients. But we do not invest into purely proprietary trading businesses going forward.",110,Yes
"Well, as you can see if you look at our third quarter reports, from the back testing results we did not have spectacular daily losses. We did have a relatively high number of loss-making days and they stemmed from positioning towards rising rates. But they were quite obviously in the quarterly results in that environment relatively material, so that we felt we needed to talk about them. They were obviously not material in a Group sense and in an annual sense, and I guess you will always have some proprietary bets that will work out better than others. I don't think it's the nature and is sensible in the business to essentially hedge everything away, so you will always have some bets that materialize better than the others.",128,No
Right now it's early in the game. It is sparse control out there and our plan right now is to drill our next well in the offset section is our plan right now. And we're going to make a determination once we see a little bit more longevity on our production profile and see what we might be able to do with that.,63,Yes
"In looking at the Rockies, that particular area was off approximately 3%. Some of that is result of some timing and some shut-in issues we had in our [Wamsutter] area. Jeff, do you want to mention any of the -- some of the things that we've seen up there whether it be impression or maintenance operations or things that have affected us?",62,Yes
"Well, I will let Mike follow on Brian with what I say but certainly cost inflation we're seeing it across the board. A common theme with the entire space. But we also have allocated additional sums to our lease acquisition program where we're continuing to find opportunities to enhance our future position.",52,No
"In our guidance on the last page we give you guidance that kind of says there's going to be kind of 2.7 to $3.0 million of expense related to stock, is what we're guessing at right now going forward. We have been carving out stock comp in our guidance and in our press releases for a couple of years now since we moved to performance shares. Part of what's in this in that below the line cumulative effect is the FAS 123 adoption where we're not quite sure how that is all going to shake out moving forward in terms of the volatility. We're going to have to do some actuarial work each quarter to value options to get a number to expense. So right now all we can tell you is I'd go with the 2.7 to $3.0 million for the guidance.",143,No
"I'm going to let Mike follow up with this also, Eric. But we have, certainly we had some information out there and we put together a fairly large and contiguous acreage position out there. And there has been some recent area activity that has been encouraging. And I will let Mike pick up from there.",55,No
"The comm business is a -- in the last few quarters, we are flat or slightly down. And so they have a refresh, okay. And we gained some market shares. And -- but there's a significant portion of it. We see the 5G network start to ramp. And those product, we designed it back in -- a couple years ago.",60,Yes
"Yes. Again, I think if you look at the results, clearly, what we saw in computing and storage, automotive and industrial, those weren't onetime drivers. This is all about the secular expansion that we've been discussing now for several years, and we're now seeing the results come in full term. And so I don't see anything in my -- in the outlook that would indicate a diminution of those growth rates. And then as far as how we manage the margin with the consumer, that's something that we're adept at being able to do. So I think that as we look at Q4, we feel very confident not just in the number in total, but also the individual markets as far as they're going to source that growth.",128,Yes
"The high inventory -- again, it's my favorite now, okay. High inventory, in a company like MPS, we have to build a reputation. With regard to traditional, we'll achieve it and we will ship our products. And where we're the newcomers, we have to have a record of reliability as well as a continuation of our delivery. We'll never have that kind of problems. Any one glitch that cause a lot more problems, much bigger market cap hit, then a few million dollars and a few days of inventory.",89,Yes
"Yes. I hate to say that in the last couple of times that we talked about gaming, our customers not happy, okay. We can't do that. And the one time I said that it wasn't my favorite topic, okay, our customer heard that. Okay, so gaming is my favorite. There's a lot of money to be made with 100% of the components, okay. But here is what have we got, and again, we see high volumes. And we're not talking about what kind of gaming, okay, we see a bit of softness. And these are high-volume ones. And other than that, we see connected device or the IoT, if you will, okay, and a variety of other gauges. And we see -- in our designing, we see the market demand is still very similar.",134,Yes
"So we're basically prepared to be able to service the targeted markets. And we believe that, as you look to the first half of '19, that they are less impacted by the price sensitivities that might be -- occur as a result of the tariffs or geopolitical trade policies. And then as Michael just said, that on the areas that are more affected, we have the ability to course correct, and as we demonstrated in Q3, even within the quarter, to be able to achieve our revenue goals.",88,Yes
"I think talking about McDermott, and again, I don't want to elaborate too much in the -- on this possible combination. What we are talking about -- what we would be talking about, if it was to materialize, would be the -- only the McDermott business, not the CB&amp;I acquisition. If it was to happen, that would not allow us to go ahead. Regarding the backlog, I think one of the things I'm very confident with, is that during the downturn, we've kept our prudent approach, and maintaining the right risk on it is a job. We haven't changed our philosophy, and we evaluate this risk of sullen weather on a project by project basis in a prudent way. I don't see that our risk profile has increased. And I think we can take the last question.",137,No
"Yes, I will take the question on i-Tech. Ricardo will take the question on provision, and John will answer on Beatrice. Regarding the i-Tech Services, I mean, we are seeing additional volume of activity, but there is pressure on margins which have been there for a while. But more activity, but still pressure on margins. Just as a reminder, we have announced the intention to create the joint venture with OneSubsea Schlumberger, which is going to bring i-Tech Services and the IRM on both sides, the OneSubsea and our side, to the next level, driven by technology and the model stuff. So the i-Tech business is challenging today. It's one of the business line of Subsea 7 which, for me, is quite promising on the medium to long term through the joint venture with Schlumberger. So I see future there. Regarding the...",142,Yes
"Michael, I'll pass on the first question for you. With regards -- I mean, we are, as you know, as I've indicated we are in a strong net cash position at the moment. But I guess , the way we look at it is that we have a certain amount of cash that we need for operating our business, you'll see our working capital if you will, and a portion as well which we allocate for strategic opportunity. As I indicated earlier, our main priority is reinvesting in the business for growth. I do want to clarify, we don't have a credit rating. As such, we have an investment-grade profile, and that investment-grade profile would allow us should be want to raise additional debt, whilst it's not in any way undermining it. I'm not implying by that, that is -- I'm not implying by that, that we intend to raise the debt in short term for the purposes of returning the cash to shareholders. As i indicated earlier, it is the -- it's one of our 3 top priorities, but it's just third, and we don't have any plans to change that approach.",193,No
"I didn't answer one point, which was the cost savings. I think, we, today, are at a point where we have reduced the size of our organization to size it to the full swing operation. We kept the expertise, and that's absolutely key for me. The future cost saving will be through even further optimization in the way we work to lower the cost of the project, and that will have an impact on the bottom line. Efficiency and different -- we're working, in particular, in partnership with some of our clients will trigger cost saving in the way we do a project and therefore have impact on the bottom line. That's where I see it.",116,No
"I mean, the way we look at this combination is how to improve our business and be more efficient. I mean, there is -- we are not doing that to taking competitors after the market. We are building something, which is more efficient and, therefore, bring additional advantage. I think we need to move to the next question.",58,Yes
"Yes, right. Yes, we had a number of people that were working -- the Germans and the U.K. were working together. So they were working in the security area, which we basically with the sale, we lost the engineers and a lot of them were salespeople and support people. So we let a number of them go. And then we realigned sort of the support staff in the U.K. so that we can service our existing customer base, but cut back the number of people. So that's what the severance costs were for.",93,Yes
"Well, we've got -- yes, there's some spare parts and there was a few royalty boards not a plane or anything like that, Brett. It was very small. And we don't have really much in the second quarter, and it really looks like we'll have some stuff in the third and fourth quarter. But as Victor noted, we haven't really gotten in that much information out of Lockheed as to what the delivery schedule will be.",76,Yes
"Well, first of all, the inventory, a lot of it is -- a big portion of that is timing for orders. So within the TS group. So a lot of it's drop ship, so things shift. So under the revenue recognition rules, a lot of times we don't get to do it and we don't get notice, so that's a big chunk of it. And the receivables, probably, I mean, as far as there's good flow on the cash, it's just on the business side what happens. So as we get more growth, we hopefully will have bigger numbers in there in the short term.",105,Yes
"Well, see a lot of the pipeline that we're looking at right now with larger organizations, multi-billion organizations where we're -- our managed wireless practice, as I mentioned in the past, has been doing really, really well. And that's one of the areas that a lot of companies -- sometimes when you look at managed services, they may not be as interested as taking over their full infrastructure, but a lot of companies and multi-billion dollar companies don't want to manage wireless, so that's something that we're talking to a lot of large organizations, whether financial or school systems that we're looking at taking their wireless infrastructure over as a managed service recurring revenue model. So that's where that comment comes from.",122,Yes
"Yes, so Joe, I'd give you a little more color on that. What we've done is we've pushed the suppliers as hard as we could to get these brand new boards with the latest and greatest technology on the chipset. So that chip, which is just being released, is something that we need because we need the power to support all the software we're loading on it. So what we did was we get -- they gave us a few boards that were basically not even tested. We did a lot of the testing for them, and then they had to -- go back and make all the changes. We recently just got the next set of boards in our hands. And from what we can see, everything is looking good. But there's a bunch of all the testing they need to do for them to certify it, so they could do it and send it out to the public. That's GA for them, and that's kind of where we're at right now.",173,Yes
"I don't know. I've said all along -- I mean we're testing different -- different applications will be tested like mobile, like targeted advertising. But as I've said all along, I don't believe -- I believe that by the time it's fully deployed and with the rate with which things are changing, that the winning business model may not even been thought of yet, Kyle. As I've said before, we view it the way our strategy -- head of strategy puts it, we view it sort of like the iPhone; that this new platform will be put out there and other money and developers will come and write some really interesting programs for that application. So, i.e., will the driverless car happen faster -- sooner rather than later and then the entertainment in an automobile moves from audio to video as an example. So I think the answer is we don't know yet.",153,No
"The rate of investments should tail off, Marci. As soon as we got hot on the selling ads side of the business, we saw this data management platform opportunity, so we've invested in the technology or the people to do that but that rate of what I call the back-end expense will slow down. The zero margin of the business is related and a lot to that expense investment. The absolute selling and cost of goods sold is already a profitable business.",82,Yes
"We don't call out individual stations. We've talked about this on the call last time. For the quarter, it was less than double digits. So it's embedded in our base business at this point and we're not calling it out but it's about that kind of ballpark for about 5.5 weeks.",51,No
"Well, it's a test, right? So we're -- our Phoenix station will keep on running our ATSC 1.0. What we're collaborating on together is we're using other people's sticks to test 3.0. And so, the consortium will be all testing, we'll be testing different aspects of the platform, different codes, different applications for different business models, so it is a test. It is not whether or not Phoenix lights up permanently in 3.0 or we do that in other markets first is yet to be determined but it is truly a collective laboratory for the broadcasters.",96,Yes
"No. I don't believe that at all. First of all, when you look at first and second quarters and different years, they are sort of meaningful. If you look at history, they don't really track much with what -- all that revenue comes in the third and fourth and sometimes, a bit in June. No. I think that's absolutely -- in fact, we've seen very detailed breakouts by people in the ecosystem that are controlling those dollars, two very specific agencies. And the amount of dollars spent on TV, we think will be up significantly and I think so the share shift story has been talked about for a long time. Certainly, cable has been picking up share, especially in House races and large markets over the years. Digital has been taking dollars that used to go to direct mail, a lot of it. But the fact of the matter is the pie is going to be so much bigger and by all -- by every inside agency not somebody who has a specific axe to grind in the ecosystem or a bias in the ecosystem but when you talk to the agencies that control those dollars, they'll tell you television is going to be up. And broadcast specifically will be up.",212,No
I want to thank everyone again for joining us on the call this morning. And I look forward I think we're really excited about the opportunity on our next quarterly conference call as well as our Investor Day in May. We will have our entire new leadership team at that Investor Day. We will walk through a lot more detail the strategy and the initiatives we have underway to transform this company to a services business platform. And we look forward to spending the day with everyone in New York in May. Have a great day. Thank you very much.,100,No
"I'm -- actually I have Dan Stone, the President of CompuCom in the room. And I'm going to have Dan answer that. Again, I'll talk about '18 real fast. We're excited that we believe CompuCom is going to be flat, which is a pretty big reversal of the business, but I'll let Dan comment for a few minutes then I'll jump in as well at the end. Go ahead, Dan.",70,No
"This is Joe Lower, why don't I wrap up the call and just providing some perspective on Q1. We do not intend to regularly provide guidance on a quarterly basis. But thought given the guidance coming out this time of the year and where we are in the year, it was helpful to provide some context. So we provided you guidance for the full year in the amount of $10.6 billion. We typically see somewhere between 24% to 20% -- 26% of our total sales actually recognized in Q1. We anticipate this year, Q1 will be at the lower end of that range, as some of the revenue growth initiatives that Gerry discussed, really don't materialize until the second half of the year. And in the operating income, we provided total guidance for the year of $350 million. As a percentage of total, we expect Q1 to be slightly lower as a percent in the 21% to 22% of total range as the investments we are making are generally front-end loaded with the benefits being realized in the second half of the year.
 So hopefully that gives you some sense of how we're looking at Q1 at this time. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gerry for his closing comments.",212,No
"Well, this is Gerry. I think you saw that we're optimistic in 2018, that we're going to be flat on an overall BSD basis. So and we see -- we saw 150 basis point improvement in Q4 to the BSD business. So as we talked about in all the previous earning calls, we're starting to see traction. Every quarter we've improved and we actually think we have line of sight to '18 to have the business flat, which has been the first time in a long, long time that business is in that direction so. And we're optimistic that we've turned the corner and we're past those headwinds on the acquisition and we're moving forward into getting into a -- helping consolidate the market in that space.",127,Yes
"Well, there's some great cross-selling opportunities and we've seen some early wins that's we're all happy about on both sides of the business. We did see a 150 basis point improvement sequentially as I said earlier. And we're basically committing '18 to be flat for the year or so. We're saying that's going to continue improve through the year. And we see that the headwinds from the previous Staples acquisition are behind us. And we're very optimistic that by stabilizing that core, I think it's a huge inflection point for the company that CompuCom is flat, so we have $1.1 billion and sticky stable revenue and a lot of EBITDA around that, as well as the BSD team -- business being stabilized is a huge statement that we've strengthened our core business. And obviously, as we said pretty clearly, we got to continuing to our retail transformation and drive to more services-led store experience over a period of time will stabilize the retail business as well. But I'm very, very pleased that we're looking at a positive trend in BSD and that we're going to have a flat year in 2018.",191,Yes
"Corey, thanks for [attaining] the call. Obviously everything and natural gas is no different, in fact, probably (inaudible) more volatility in North America than most other commodities. It goes up and down and we are at a trough of the cycle right now, so to speak, and that's why we feel that this is the perfect time to do the kind of things we are doing, and i.e. is to acquired assets that maybe other people are not keen on because of the outlook in prices.
 Obviously North American natural gas is a fairly tight supply/demand dynamics in the whole commodity and, therefore, the reduced utilization reported by the drillers are very real in the sense that if there are not enough wells drilled during any period of time to replace declines then you can hopefully look forward to an upcycle in the pricing because of the simple supply and demand equation.",152,Yes
"Definitely you're referring to our 9 5/8 bond that auto-matures in 2010, actually the first call date we just passed it on July 15 of this year. So, we have the flexibility. Now to look at the refinancing, the 9 5/8, (inaudible) I'm sure you're aware of the current situation with the corporate debt market almost worldwide, definitely North American-wide.
 At the moment, I'm not really sure the environment is conducive and positive enough for us to contemplate a refinancing issue, but we will continue to monitor market. There is an opportunity to lower our borrowing cost on a go-forward basis, but we do have to pay 4.8% half coupon as a take out premium on the whole bond.
 So, there is a bit of a economic calculation there as to when would you break even, so to speak, in terms of replacing the old coupon with the new coupon, but we're looking at that and this is definitely dictated by market conditions.",163,No
"Yes, I don't think the (inaudible) plays a huge part in the supply situation for North American gas, but definitely we are quite weather-dependent in terms of the supply/demand equation and we do have weather, whether it is hurricanes in the summer months, or later summer months, I guess, because we're already into August, we're not seeing a lot of that, and we get cold weather sooner than later in the winter months, then I would think that the response of natural gas price would be more accelerated.",88,Yes
"Okay, I guess a quick answer would be no, because obviously we are not obligated to alter the corporate structure until 2011, as you stated. So at the moment we are managing the Baytex entity under the income trust model. Our objective, our mandate is to deliver basically consistent return, minimize dilution to our unit holders and paid out the assigned distributions as you see at the present time, and until we make a decision at the timing in the form of the change, I do believe it is another transaction that will change our metrics. That is the target of our operating model and financial model is to keep where we are on a constant basis until we address the change in the tax law.",126,No
"Yes, we can consider, although I guess as to--as time goes on, the next call date is July 15 of 2008 and our take-out premium is reduced by 50%. So, again, economic decision and you will see that if you wait long enough, so to speak, you might as well wait to the next call date so you don't have to pay as much take-out premium.",66,No
"Well, I see -- anytime you have permitting in question, you slow down the feedstock to the market place. So, that bubble is moving through right now and is tightening the market. The result will be -- there will be some agreement to handle these fields and streams and all of that differently but it will cost more money. The market is going to shift to the lowest cost, especially after the scrubbers are built. So I would say some of the marginal players will go out and that will continue to keep the market tight.",96,Yes
"Definitely. Yeah, we'll -- because diesel is not a big cost to us other than our river transportation. We're doing some hedging on that. But in terms of production of coal, it's basically our source of power is electricity and so I would say we're going to be very stable on our cost structure, assuming the anomaly of Buchanan is out of the way and if you look at the other mines, cost structure is very solid.",77,Yes
"Also, John, just keep in mind that we really emphasize margin as opposed to just cost of revenue. So, in some places, particularly like Central App that has a higher cost structure, if we're maintaining margins or increasing margins, we have no problem with bringing on mines that have -- I'm just throwing out a number that could have costs even at $50 a ton, if we're going to get $60 a ton for the coal. And sometimes just focusing on cost, you may get the wrong impression because you may see some increases in costs. I think the key thing is to look to see at the margins, are the margins increasing.",113,Yes
"I would say we prefer to run that mine if the contract is right. We haven't seen utilities typically take that coal. It had a real advantage based on sulfur and as the scrubbers get built, its advantage gets taken away. So, it is one of the highest costs of the Pittsburgh HC mines and it is always going to be the one on the margin based on geology and I think in a hot market, you're going to see it probably -- it could be extended. But the customers have to step up, otherwise we're going to maximize our low cost position and keep our low cost mines at the highest margins. I guess that's up in the air would be the right -- would be the right response to you right now.",134,Yes
"Well, I would say the export market is a sustainable market. I would say the next three years for sure. Now, the real question in my mind is, is the dollar going to continue to stay weak, will that trigger long-term contracts between CONSOL and Atlantic market for the high BTUs that we have in our properties. If that's the case, I think you'll us actually make capital commitments for expansion to meet that market. But I can tell you the same thing with the domestic market. The only issue here is, John, is the Atlantic market, if the dollar continues to stay weak, they just might trigger long-term contracts meaning three to five year deals for the first time in 20 years. That will really change our market structure.",130,Yes
"Look, our outlook is we have no more crystal ball than anybody else as to whether the economy is flat or down or we're going into recession. Clearly the economy is mixed in the best case scenario.
 So what you'll see us do over the coming quarters is continue to diversify from an industry standpoint. You'll see different types of industries working their way into this portfolio, including healthcare, including energy. And you'll see us continue to invest in companies that we feel will really have really solid capital structures and can perform in almost any scenario.
 But we do not have any more crystal ball than anybody else. We're going to be judicious and prudent. Whether this market correction we are in lasts another three months or six months or a year, again we do not have any more crystal ball than anybody else. We always, though, want to make sure we have got excess capital and liquidity on hand to take advantage of opportunities.",166,No
"Well, again, is all going to be related to on one hand what the return on equity is going to be from people who are borrowing at these rates, and does that ROE go down or go up?
 Also kind on the other end of the spectrum where kind of the high yield and leveraged loan markets are trading as a proxy for liquid credit risk. So the mezzanine asset class kind of trades between those two bands.
 So that is -- look, how long do cycles last? I don't know. We had a bear market for a year or two years last time around, before it started rallying. I do not know if this is going to be a six-month phenomenon or an 18-month phenomenon.",126,Yes
"That is a great question. On the illiquid deals, a typical mezz deal has a noncall period for a while, call it two to maybe three years; some call premiums after that. You're also getting an upfront fee. So you're essentially buying it at 98 or 97.5; noncall [too]; call it 104, 103, 102, 101 after that. So there is a penalty for calling us out, and there is some lockout period.
 Also importantly in those deals there is an equity coinvest option typically. That is where you do get to participate in the upside as things get better, as companies refinance or want to dividend or IPO or sell. As an equity coinvestor we participate in that upside.",119,Yes
"I hate to give intra-quarter guidance, particularly since we keep saying we are not a production shop. You know, we are value. Some quarters will be, some quarters will be lower. So I really hesitate to give you guidance.
 We are making -- we have made investments. We are making investments. You'll see a broadening in the diversification of the portfolio.
 To your first question, about $12 million of the markdown was related to those two credits.",77,No
"Look, I think the quoted market is trading on fears of an economic slowdown, clearly. So that is what is going to drive the quoted piece of the portfolio.
 Now for us, again, we are long-term value investors. If something is trading down, and we still like the credit, and we think it is built to weather a store, and we're getting a nice yield for our shareholders, we will potentially buy more. But it is really kind of the economic uncertainty is what is hanging over the leveraged loan markets.",91,No
"Hi, Francisco. Thank you. Let me start with the minority interest. What we have is -- this item has been increasing because we have more projects with minority partners, like one in the state of Mexico and one in Hermosillo. It's only two out of the 85 projects that we have. It's on a small portion.
 We are not promoting this scheme and we believe that will remain at -- a very small portion of our projects will be on this type of partnerships. In terms of the land bank, as you know, we increased our policy from 2.5 years to three years, and we will continue with this policy of three years of future sales of land bank.
 As we mentioned, we will increase the number of cities, five new cities in the second half of this year, and that will imply us to acquire more land in these new cities. We believe, as we have shown in this quarter, that we are generating free cash flow again and this will be enough to support our land acquisitions in the future.",182,Yes
We believe that some sofoles have been doing a great job on increasing their distribution capabilities. Some banks are doing a great job and some banks are still working on the internal constraints to offer more mortgages to the middle income customers. We believe that we have a lot of opportunities on the middle-income segment due to these improvements on the offering of mortgages to our customers in the future.,70,Yes
"Thanks, Vanessa. We have increased significantly the number of mortgages, processes, through co-financing, mainly with INFONAVIT. Now we are considering the co-financing program as part of our affordable entry-level segment, as you may notice in the press release. The affordable entry-level segment now is up to MXN600,000, and we have increased the number of customers who acquire a Homex home through a co-financing program.
 In terms of the subsidy, we have been working mainly with INFONAVIT to offer this option to our customers. And the main idea is that customers who were eligible only for around a MXN150,000 home, now they can acquire a MXN180,000 home, because of this upfront subsidy that will be available for around 120,000 people or families in Mexico. We believe that we will provide this subsidy with sofoles, with FOVISSSTE, but mainly with INFONAVIT.
 In terms of the third question, the exposure for customers that base their income on remittances, at this time, the customers without a formal job is very, very small. We believe that this segment will grow in the future and we have been working with some sofoles and banks to offer products to this segment. But, at this time, it's a very small portion of our sales.",206,Yes
"Thanks, Dan. The increase in our middle-income segment was driven by new developments. Now we have around 18 different developments all over Mexico, and we have now our highest-price home is priced at MXN2.3 million. We increased the range for middle income.
 And one of the reasons of this growth has been that now we are finishing the process of having two separate structures, one for affordable and one for middle income. And that's speeding up the growth on middle income. And we believe that we have a lot of upside on this segment, because of our small participation at this time.
 And, as we mentioned, the sofoles and the commercial banks are offering more products -- more mortgages that can increase our participation in this segment. Talking about the geographic expansion, we have projects in the state of Mexico, in Guadalajara, in other medium cities like Leon, Veracruz, that have had a very good response in the last month.",160,Yes
"Thank you. We believe that with this subsidy program, the main impact will be on the segment of customers earning less than 3 minimum wages, mainly from 2.5 to 3 minimum wages, that now they will be able to access homes, economic housing, at its price of MXN180,000. That will speed up our sales, but at this time we don't have any specific number on the impact on economic housing.
 As you may know, Homex is a leading homebuilder in economic housing. We have received some awards in 2006, and we expect to receive more in 2007 as the best economic housing development in some states throughout Mexico. Our geographical presence and our size has given us this opportunity to offer the best economic housing product in many states of Mexico.",131,Yes
"Yes, I think it's just across the board. I think it's just you had -- there really was a pretty wide spread for a while between kind of the larger deals and the smaller deals. And I think that's probably just tightening a little bit. And it's not to say we aren't finding interesting opportunities out there. It's a kind of general comment that you are seeing some of the smaller sellers probably just get kind of better information about the larger deals, more things are being brokered for sure. And so of course, brokers have an impact on that kind of expectation.
 So it's not that they're lesser quality assets where the pricing expectations are higher. It's just that I think some of the smaller sellers have become smarter about where the larger deals are trading in the market.",140,No
"Yes, sure. So those are acquisitions we still have in our pipeline. And so those would require just a very modest amount of our kind of dry powder. So we're still working on those and we still think those meet our very high standards. And so anything we're looking at kind of beyond that -- those in contract acquisitions really have to have pretty good returns in order for us to find them interesting right now.
 But the $130 million is still in our pipeline and we're still working on closing those, which we expect to kind of close later this quarter.",102,No
"You mean Rental or Construction? You're talking about the Rental business unit? Okay. I'll speak about both. Construction, regarding utilization rate, it varies very little. Even during the most critical moment of the pandemic, in Q2, we maintained the Rental volume of the Construction business unit, practically unchanged. The variation is marginal. Also because infrastructure works and construction, overall, were considered essential services. With the exception of some private construction of the private industry. And in that case, the industrial plants decided that it would be best to suspend the construction in the works.
 Our outlook for the fourth quarter is positive. We have seen an ongoing improvement, gradual improvement after Q2. More specifically, May was the worst moment. It was the most critical moment of the coronavirus pandemic for our company. But since then, things have been improving. December, more specifically, is a month when seasonally, we have some impact of some collective vacations and projects that are put on hold.
 But overall, the fourth quarter expectations are positive.",170,No
"Our visibility regarding the Construction business, and it really depends on the infrastructure pipeline of projects. There are still some hurdles for these projects to be released, but we continue to be optimistic and bullish regarding 2021. Our goal is to improve the pricing in this business unit. We want to increase rented volume. And I believe that we are going to have good opportunities coming up, given the perspective of future investments in infrastructure in Brazil.",77,Yes
"The answer is yes. We have been increasing our prices, improving our prices. Already in the third quarter, very little price adjustment. But now in the fourth quarter, we will resume our policy to rebalance prices. Of course, in the critical moment of the crisis, we had to hold any price increases because we had a reduction in volume. But now it makes sense for us to resume our policy to improve our prices due to the rental rate and improving our margins. The products in the highest demand are the ones that are having faster price increases. But undoubtedly, along 2021, it is part of our plans to improve -- rebuild our prices actually and to rebalance the rental rate so that we can have an adequate return on invested capital.",132,Yes
"Sure. I mean as you know, we have been working on a turnaround plan there. And we have made some great strides in getting our cost structure back in control, looking at our contracts and renegotiating pricing so that we don't lose money on them, and that's all gone quite well. Recently, some of the large customers like McLaren, Ferrari and others, they are facing significant slow sales because China used to be one of their big markets. So because the business has now become challenging again, despite the lower cost structure, our goal remains we'll serve our customers appropriately. And at the same time, we want the profitability to stabilize and improve and continuously focus on that for now, given where we are with the overall dynamics of the market.",131,Yes
"I think we -- one thing we are confident of is controlling our internal execution and delivering on all our commitments. The range simply reflects our uncertainty on the external macro, whether kind of the macro improves in the second half or deteriorates in the second half. I think that's probably the biggest uncertainty here, Sarkis.",56,No
"Well, it should not be recurring. There were 2 separate incidents. Back in 2016, we had a customer that had faced bankruptcy. That's way before our time, and we got caught up in it. I'm thankful that issue's behind us. But I guess, recently, we had an adverse ruling on some of the payments we received from the customer post bankruptcy. We were caught off guard, and about half of the reserve is simply for that. We don't think it's fair, and we are clearly going to appeal, but we are required to book that reserve based on the 2016 bankruptcy and the ongoing legal challenges on that. Second one is product liability related to an incident back in 2018, which, again, got to a stage where, like we thought it was prudent to book a reserve. Again, our product was not at fault. We are confident that we are doing all the right things. But at the same time, prudent to book, there is no given potential opportunity to settle and avoid legal costs. But no, we don't think those should be recurring, Phil. And why? We don't exclude it from our numbers either for that reason.",198,Yes
"Yes, you're right. The primary driver, especially in area of the improvement, is around inventory. Certainly, last year, with facility moves and some of the market volatility and softness inventories, where we saw some deterioration from the prior year performance, and it's where we've really focused our improvement efforts going into 2020.",52,Yes
"Sure. So I mean we ended the year at between $8 million to $10 million in SoluMag, which is consistent with what we were expecting when we gave Q3 update. Currently, we are expecting that number to remain flat. We're not making any growth, and I think that's a prudent assumption. We are confident that there's no further downside, and we are confident that the destocking is complete.",68,Yes
"Well, let me start on the first one, then I'll turn it to Ray. And then Ray, you can give it back to me on the recession question. But gross margins, honestly, mostly, mix. I mean for sure, there is a component that I don't think affected the first quarter very much where the greatest demand -- and listen, we are prioritizing our products along with what our customers and consumers and society as a whole need. And that means that right now, we have been -- we're more than 50% of the U.S. supply of acetaminophen and that's a lower gross margin item, and we're running that, although I don't think that had a big deal impact on the first quarter. I think gross margins, in general, are mixed, but I'm pleased with our margins when you take it down to the operating margin line. You've got a lot of moving factors. Then Ray, can you go into that in a little bit more detail?",166,Yes
"Sure. So on -- I think you basically described it to a certain extent, David. But the -- we are seeing increase in some of our costs. As Murray described, we've got absenteeism in the plants that we still pay people for the most part even when they're absent under COVID-19. So we do see some higher costs there. We are getting operational leverage on all 3 businesses, it's quite significant, but that's because of the increased sales certainly in the first quarter. We're seeing momentum savings continuing. And we are paying -- we paid the special bonus we talked about, which obviously resulted in higher overall compensation costs.
 But we -- I think that on balance, if you look at operating income, as I -- operating margin and operating income, as I mentioned earlier in the call, if you look through to that, our operating expenses are down slightly. We would expect that trend to continue. And we're also expecting probably less advertising and promotional cost for the time being, plus, as you mentioned, less travel or less of those other expenses. And we are seeing just a small down in the Q1 on the -- on our operating margin, but a big increase, obviously, in our operating income.",210,No
"I just -- I'll leave you saying one more time, I keep hammering it over and over again. This is something like I've never seen. The Perrigo business is strong. The team is incredible. They're confident, they're -- my leadership team is very seasoned. They handle everything in a calm and deliberate manner, and they've been able to handle crisis, and I'm confident that while there could be some shorter-term bump, I think the outlook for Perrigo is very strong. I never anticipated this coming into the company, but I think price value, store brand product will play a bigger role going forward. I think that self-care will play a bigger role in a new normal world where consumers are a little bit more reluctant to run to the emergency room or hospitals. And I certainly think e-commerce will be a bigger role, and we're strong in each of those.
 We'll get through this. We'll have some uncertainty, and I know that's hard for everybody who's trying to cover the stocks. But I think if you sort of look where Perrigo stands today versus most companies in the world, I think we're performing pretty darn well. And I -- so I'll just end it one more time, thanking all the employees who I know it's nervous to come into the facilities, but you're doing good for society, and you should be very proud, and we're very proud of you. Thank you for your interest in Perrigo.",246,Yes
"Sure. Murray is right. You've really got to look at operating margin, especially with respect to the fact that we saw increases in our store brand business, where our gross margins are lower, but our operating margins are similar. And we saw that in the CSCA specifically, which you referenced, our margin this year at around -- operating margin around 19.6%, contrasts positively by about 130 basis points versus what we've got in 2019 first quarter. So we're seeing -- we are seeing some improvement in our operating margin. And the impact of the dislocations that happened really didn't have a big impact on Q1 because they happened late in March or in the middle of March, early to middle-March, and we didn't see all that much impact coming through from that. We did see some, as I say, some impacts at the end of the month but then we saw operating leverage from the sharp increase in sales that came in March.",163,Yes
"And then going back to the recession question. I mean you're right, Chris. You know what, we'll see how it plays out, but our product category -- and I already think we're seeing some share shifting now, but the fact is our products are of equal application, and they're 30% to 40% cheaper than the national brand. And the other benefit you'd get in a surge is that a lot of times the national brands are not on shelf. So besides the longer-term benefit that you get of the price issue, you also get people trying. You get a much higher level of trial right now. There's a lot more people that have tried a store brand who are buying both or who were normally national brand-only consumers that are trying and buying our products and seeing for themselves that they work just as well.
 So listen, going into an extended risk recession period, private label always performs well. And history, I mean, there's no guarantees, but history says we'd benefit from that. And we think that we're well positioned with our self-care focus, our value and also the e-commerce.
 But yes, I mean, it's a great point. These are uncertain times, and I think the company is in a real good position right now to help society, but also benefit from it.",223,Yes
"Thank you very much. Talk to you again on Friday. So key conclusion is, it was a very challenging year, and we managed to stabilize the company. And even in those challenging circumstances we haven't pushed the break on the activities that the company needs to take to deliver long-lasting, sustainable profitability and -- because we are confident about this is the right thing to do. This is the message and talk to you on Friday.",76,No
"I think somehow -- let's see, how can I phrase it, you have the building blocks. I mean we have been communicating that Delta4000 delivers 3% to 5% better margin. We have been communicating, and we will communicate as well in Q3 call, the share of the order intake that is coming from Delta4000. So this is going to signal you or is signaling us where the profitability in 2021 might land because it's a question of percentage of Delta4000 and improvement of the margin of Delta4000 versus the legacy products.
 And then on top of that, in 2021, as we speak, but especially in 2021, we execute supply chain expansion with substantial margin improvement, and that's what is supporting 2022. So 2022 is effect of keeping the quality of the order intake that we'll start to see in the execution in 2021 and adding the better product costs that we will get out of India.",156,Yes
"I think we don't have -- I mean, we have a high-level view, but we don't have concluded nor approved the 2021 budget. So the decision that we took as a Management Board is to stick to the financial calendar of the company, but start signaling you what we are doing in order to achieve the midterm profitability that this company is going to deliver.",65,No
"I think this year, the CapEx, if I'm not mistaken, around EUR 170 million, we will talk more specific in the Q3 call. Next year, we will guide the year in due time early next year. We don't see a major as of today. I mean, with all the footnotes, we didn't see any major deviation. I think this is very much the CapEx that is in the planning for the supply chain expansion in India, plus the transportation and logistics and installation tools for creating above 6-gigawatt capacity in Delta4000 product, including the engineering activities to support this platform.",100,Yes
"Thank you very much for your questions, Sebastian. You're right. The overall one-off impact COVID related, plus one-off impact the EPC project is approx EUR 300 million. Further details will be given in the Q3 call on Friday. In order to disclose the book value of the sale of Nordex development, I don't think we will do that because it's quite complex because part was already implicitly within the budget. Nonetheless, further information will be given by Christoph on the Q3 call next Friday.
 So from my side, Sebastian, the message is, it's a big number, indeed. The reasons is the ones that I mentioned, substantial impacts in the production facility of blades, mainly Spain, Mexico as well India. So this reduced output creates substantially more cost, which triggers project lease, which is EBITDA impact. And then the second biggest block is the execution in Argentina. That is one-off because we are finalizing the project execution there, and we don't plan to execute more volume in Argentina next year.
 And South Africa, where we are in the process to stabilize project execution in South Africa. And next year, we feel that we are equipped to deliver the good quality backlog that we have in Europe and U.S. mainly.",208,Yes
"Yes. Jane, thanks. And that was an exacting question, and I may not give you as exacting an answer because there is a -- it's not a specific point perhaps in that range where we would turn that back on. It also has to do with what our outlook would be beyond this current fiscal year. So as we look into -- look, we expect we will delever as we go through the year. And there will come a time where we will assess quite seriously whether or not we decide to reengage in terms of our buyback.
 It is not a matter of if. It is a matter of when. So that, I will be exacting on, but again as I said, Q1, Q2, we think we have a pretty good feel for and insight into. Q3, Q4, we really need to take a look and realize what the markets may look like at that time. Our range stays the same. Look, it won't be long to where inevitably we think likely we will trend down toward the bottom of that. And then that probably does go back to your point, which is it's just a number and it's just that plug. And absent M&amp;A, certainly buybacks will come to life.",212,No
"Yes. Andy, good question. And you kind of answered it for me towards the end when you said you thought maybe that more is not bad. And I think there's a very good point around that.
 In the end, the win in Specialty is really the shift in terms of the rental penetration. So it is the shift from ownership to rental is the big, big prize. And to have only 1 specialist in a market probably doesn't drive that the way that we would want it to. So more than 1 is not bad. Let's be clear. Albeit our Specialty businesses are different, there is a -- another competitor in North America who does emphasize their Specialty business, which I can only imagine they will continue to do so. Ours are a bit different.
 The bigger question really is, well, who can? And we no doubt will have 1 or 2 others that do that, but beyond that point, anyone with any sort of significant scale, they're not obvious. So hence the reason why we will continue to amplify our efforts the way that we will through more openings, broader coverage, more fleet investments come and better cross-selling. But Specialty is certainly a theme that will not be going away any time I can see in the future.",219,Yes
"No. I mean we, no different than in North America, look to be the leading provider. The leading provider in the U.K., I think, most certainly will continue to be also the largest. Yes, there's a rebranding, but as you will have picked up from the spirit of this, we know through all the work we've done in the business that there is a significant increase in revenue opportunity if we simply just cross-sell among these specialties. We have customers who we do virtually all of their work, let's just take for instance, in the ground protection or formerly known as live business. We have customers that we do 100% of their ground protection. And we did none of their telehandlers, none of their lights, none of their power and none of their HVAC.
 Well, I think what you're going to find is we are going to leverage the relationships with those customers. Pricing is not going to be our heading. Good service is going to be our heading. And we think that the customers there will see savings on their end simply through efficiencies. So during this period of gain that we've experienced since early March through today, I can tell you that pricing has not been on one single headline.",212,Yes
"Yes. Well, look, I think the -- will the regionals get there? This last 90 days has certainly not helped. So if you think about some of the regionals that are out there in terms of their current financial condition, they're probably not talking about GBP 792 million of free cash flow and looking forward to a year of another record free cash flow. So look, if they do, it's going to be a hell of a long time. And when that time may come, we will be on to bigger and better and the newer things.
 This is not something that we stop with. This is a very, very foundational element of our go-forward strategy.",116,No
"Yes, of course. Good questions. Well, let's start with the -- let's start with fall-through, as you said, and speaking to EBITDA margins. Obviously, as you will have heard from Michael, very early on, in a business like ours you're going to have a disproportionately high fall-through. You have a certain fixed-cost base, particularly given the strategic decisions that we've taken, but you will see that moderate.
 I mean keep in mind also there will be certain provisions at the end of a year during times like this that you will take that will have a further drag on that. I would -- as you know, we're not giving much in terms of guidance. I would say you'll see it improve as we progress toward where our revenue levels were.
 I don't know if Michael, as he is in London, has anything to add to that. And then I'll go on to the next questions that you have.",158,No
"Yes. Q3 and Q4 should look better than Q1 and Q2. And I remember, after Q1, people asked -- or there was a question that came up that said, trying to get me on guidance and things like that. What does Q2 look like? And I said, I don't think anybody can predict what Q2 or Q3 is going to bring. But I said, why don't we start at 0 and every penny above that, we'll be very, very happy for it. So are we happy with $1.2 million? No, but that's what we've got. And we're facing something that we've never faced before, and we're going to work our way through that. And I only thank our team and everybody within the organization that has stepped up in finding ways to cut costs. And quite frankly, we started that from day 1. We just accelerated once the pandemic started.",150,No
"When you're -- well, you got 150 practices, there's -- a lot of those practices that have more than 1 dermatologist. So it totals about 500 dermatologists in their 150 practices. And so in the state of Florida, there's a few thousand dermatologists. It's a big market with a lot of dermatologists within the state. So we go from our 90 practices that represent about 300, 400 physicians that use our equipment in the state to now about 150. The exact number in the state of Florida is 1,568 dermatologists. So we're approximately now in over 1/3 of the dermatology practices in the state of Florida.",106,Yes
"James, this is Javier. So basically, on the G&amp;A, we had a very good decrease of the G&amp;A. I think it's going to be maintained -- I'm sorry, sales and marketing. Sales and marketing is going to be reduced practically in Q2 because of the sales, it's directly related to sales. So the less sales that we have and the less participation in the threshold, it's going to reduce the sales and marketing. On the -- on R&amp;D, we still have some projects that we're working on, especially also with the laser. So it will maintain probably the level through the end of the year.",105,Yes
"Thank you, Jess. Appreciate it. So in closing, I want to thank you once again for your time this afternoon and for your interest in Sensus. We continue to move forward on multiple fronts in spite of the pandemic and are optimistic about our prospects when we return to a more typical business pattern. Thanks again. Have a good day and be safe. Thank you.",65,No
"I want to further that James to you because it was a very, very good question. Javier answered the expense side of it. And I think that we have that under control pretty much between now and the end of the year, and it's not going to be reflective on sales or marketing. But in sales and marketing, listen, we wish that we had 10x more expenses on sales -- on the sales and marketing piece because we'd have the sales to go with it, therefore, the revenue to go with it. But a lot of our business and presentations had to be conducted via Zoom. But now we're starting to see action where the doors are opening up, and the doctors are asking us to come in for those presentations.
 So I would suspect that the sales and marketing expense will go up slightly in Q3 and might get to normal numbers in Q4. And so that part of the business, I think, will benefit, and we'll see an increase there, but I think we'll see an increase in revenues as well.",183,Yes
"Okay. Just on the internal options on power. Tony's here and I know he'd be absolutely thrilled to talk about those options a little bit later.
 But we've got 2 basically around 100-megawatt options we're looking at. One at Mogalakwena, which would be solar. We'd use excess solar capacity to generate hydrogen, and we'll be installing a hydrogen -- and it's a hybrid hydrogen battery truck by the end of the year. Tony, I think that's the plan in terms of the work you're doing with NG, it's the partnership with NG. That would be a precursor to a broader commitment on hydrogen options for our off-truck -- off-highway truck fleet. That's part of our whole carbon gas or decarbonization strategy.
 We're also looking at something in the Northern Cape. We've had discussions with the various ministers in South Africa, very supportive of those types of options. Their main point is that they are not keen to see people selling back into grid. So you do a self-contained system, which works perfectly for what we want to do because we would use excess capacity to generate hydrogen so that we continue to decarbonize on a much broader footprint. So that's absolutely critical. And that logic holds for any jurisdiction we're in. So I think that's part of this pathway 2 in terms of improvement.
 In terms of the '19 targets, I think we're about -- our target was 22% by -- yes -- So we're at about...",247,Yes
"Look, one thing that we've seen from South Africa is a pretty responsible approach in terms of taxation and its fiscal regime. I don't think that's going to change much under the finance minister. We know the finance minister very well.
 However, given the circumstances, one has to be careful not to assume you know. So we'll wait and see like everyone else. But again, I'd make the point that the finance minister and South Africa generally has tended to be fiscally conservative. And certainly, we don't expect anything untoward. There may be adjustments. We'll wait and see.",98,No
"Yes, sure. On PGM projects, we remain focused on investing in the right things. I'm always a bit cautious on getting too excited in the short term over prices because what goes up quick can come down twice as quick.
 I'm certainly one that would say the underlying demand fundamentals appear to be very strong. But at the same time, we would still expect to see some switching from palladium to platinum over time. Interesting to see the platinum price start to jump around a little bit as well. So we'll see what that actually means. But from our point of view, we're investing in the right things. We've made it very clear that we're pushing along with Mogalakwena. Not exactly sure what the final outcome at Mogalakwena will be, but for our point of view, that's a priority project. It stands on its own 2 feet, either at long-term pricing or current pricing. And we'll keep pushing that along pretty aggressively.
 We're also very keen on the Amandelbult modernization program as well and getting the chrome out at full capacity as well.
 So we've got a number of strings to our bow in South Africa. It's very exciting.",199,Yes
"So -- and most of that's Los Bronces, reflecting the Los Bronces water options that are being developed. Good work being done, but we've kept those options in. So again, Aaron and the [force] done good work, and we'll continue to build the inventory. I'd like to think by the end of the year, we'll be in a much better position generally in terms of being able to cope with these types of conditions because I think we're in our second year of 100-year -- so we've had our second 100-year drought, so we'll have to see where that ends up.",101,Yes
"On the ore sorting, I'm going to look at Tony, make sure he's nodding or shaking his head when I say this.
 The range of upgrade that we've seen is up to 20% on grade. And we balance that back, making sure that we've got the ore through the mill balanced. And that -- and what you're doing is making sure you tail is not of such a quality that you're throwing away value. So maybe 10%, on average, Tony and Ruben, in that range? In terms of balancing the circuit?",91,No
"That's correct, Mike. It's the same process that we've been talking about now for a couple of years, and we're really pleased with the progress on those agreements that we've signed over the last couple of years, and we just talked about 2 additional ones that just keep the pipeline filled up frankly.",53,Yes
"There is a lot going on there, Wolf, that we're looking to attack. The $50 million includes cost takeouts relative to 2019 levels in both SGA&amp;E fixed cost as well as above the plant COGS. So these aren't plant actions necessarily, but they're overall oversight in governance aspects of running the business. So really when we look at any incremental plant actions on the direct labor side or on the actual facility closures, those would be incremental.",77,No
"Yes, Josh, it's Jon. I can shed a little bit more light there. For us, our customer mix over in China is much more significantly weighted to the western joint venture OEMs as opposed to the China domestics. And last year, 2019, that business was down almost 30%, while the market was down 15% to 19% or so. So you've got that mix phenomenon of our customer base. And so this year, you're seeing strong improvements year-over-year in volumes coming out of those western joint venture OEMs. In particular for us, we saw volume improvements driven by the GM OEM joint ventures on some global programs. So that has certainly helped the mix for us year-over-year and why we had some outsized performance compared to the market overall.",128,Yes
"Yes. Yes, I got the question now. Remember, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the bonus variation being about $22 million year-over-year. In the prior year, we actually reversed accruals. So that showed up as income in the quarter to the tune of $10 million, whereas this year, we're continuing to accrue and you've got $11 million of expense. So the combined year-over-year impact in that cost reduction or /increase column in the 10-Q is showing a $21 million overall variance year-over-year.",83,No
"Yes, Bob, it's Jon again. We definitely have working capital initiatives that remain in-flight and they're long-term in nature. So think about inventory levels coming down over time. Think about days payable going up as we work to rationalize our supply base. So both of those should be accretive to working capital. Each successive year here is how we're looking at it. But you're absolutely right. In a rising sales environment, you always -- or you typically have a working capital usage on the accounts receivable or tooling receivable side. So we're looking to optimize that as best we can with the initiatives we've got in-flight.",106,No
"This is Terry. I think what we are seeing is a lot of that is the benefit of an improving mix. To Mark's point, our food service business has been growing at a healthy clip through the fourth quarter. That's been something that we'd seen on an ongoing basis, and to the extent that continues, we benefit, we mix up. We've also benefited from some pretty healthy immediate consumption performance in our packaged beverage business and the margins associated with that are significantly accretive to the future consumption business. So I think the combination of those two things probably played the biggest role. There was certainly no across-the-board focus on taking rate of pricing up, per se.",117,Yes
"Mix was up a bit. Only two points, it went from 61% to 63% in terms of credit card mix. That really wasn't the real driver. Really it was what I had mentioned in the script, which was the environmental piece. We expect some lower reimbursement on a number of environmental claims, so we needed to reflect that. That was again the main driver which was about $0.009 within the quarter",71,No
"Sure. Historically, maintenance capital has ranged anywhere from $50 million to $60 million. We've got IT investments in the, call it, $10 million range for 2011. A lot of the remaining components are really dedicated towards Project Fresh and reimaging, both the Project Fresh piece, but also Marathon rebranding. So we are putting a sizable amount of capital to work for the initiatives that Terry had mentioned.",67,No
"I think from a QSR standpoint, our business has been pretty healthy throughout 2010 and we continue to see a solid performance from the QSR perspective, as well as across food service in general. So when we talk about food service, we sort of bifurcate it into QSRs, which are third parties with whom we have arrangements, and then our own proprietary food service business. And both of those categories have continued to perform quite well.
  We believe that the consumer is value-oriented, coming out of the recession. We think that's a pretty fundamental change. We think that people are probably going to be much more focused on saving, and are they are careful with their discretionary income, which is why we've made some of the changes we have.
  For example, on our coffee offering, we have a lower entry price point than we had before, so we are trying to do some things to reflect that new prudency in terms of spending money that we are seeing from consumers. We've also -- our promotional activities are really focused around value. So everything that we are doing in the fourth quarter, and we continue to do in the first quarter from a promotional standpoint, is around providing bundled discounts for on-the-go meals and snacks, because we think that's going to be more important than ever.",225,Yes
"Sure. As I mentioned, we saw widespread improvement across all categories, excluding cigarettes. So a combination of increased food service mix in our grocery category, which we classify as grocery improvement in packed-bev, beer and wine across the board, and especially with our QSRs as well, that business continues to perform well. So we are seeing gross margin improvement across all categories. And that really was the foundation for our guidance.",71,Yes
"Yes. It's quite simple, actually. I told you that we de-risked the asset allocation of the Life business. So that means we have less equity in there, less shares in there, more bonds. And that means that the possibility for future capital gains has decreased. And therefore the possibility to allocate future bonuses has decreased as well. Which translates in less future bonuses, which translates in higher embedded value.",69,Yes
"And then, Group Life was the question; do we get the new business from autonomous foundations, or is it from other full service providers? It's the latter.
 The main business comes from a former employer of yours, and some others. We have also new business from autonomous foundations, but in some cases the problem is that if there's an under coverage and the customer leaves the foundation, then somebody has to take care of the gap. And if the gap is very small, then solutions can be found, but if the gap is something one should talk about, then this is has to some extent, in some cases, a lock-in effect.
 We expect as soon as the coverage ratio will increase, and it has already improved by the autonomous foundations, that we actually will see some more new business from these foundations, since many customers like to focus more on their risk from the business side, and not so much the risk from the pension business on their own balance sheet.
 So we see a certain need, especially for the small and medium-sized businesses in Switzerland. There's a huge interest in a full coverage model, and this has not been harmed for instance by the result on the opinion poll of the decision on the conversion rate. I think it's still a very attractive product to many customers, the Group Life business.
 Now there was a question on the PIGS exposure. Martin?",242,Yes
"I think important there is that's just how the technical statement is made currently. The technical statement of the Life business, as the whole unit-linked business, goes in and goes out again.
 So therefore that's a bit confusing, especially so if you look at the benefits to policy holders because they have increased so much. That's mainly the unit-linked business and you have the investment type premiums, of course they have increased, but that's not the difference, it's the portfolio on the unit-linked business.
 I think the main driver of the EBIT was really the investment income, or put it the other way round, a lot less impairments than the year before, that's actually the --",116,Yes
"To add to your information, to what German said, if you see the change of the embedded value regarding future bonuses, it's not so much the bonus of the new business; also affected is the terminal dividend on existing contracts.
 And as you might know, we have an existing book where we have quite high guarantees from former times. We have contracts in Switzerland that have a 3.5% interest rate as a guarantee. There are other ones between 3% and 3.5%, and so on. And here, a high terminal dividend is not justified any more, given our asset allocation, given the forward rates we see in the capital markets.
 So we made a bigger adaptation here and are in line with the market. It's not so that only Baloise has done some corrections here, but also some competitors.
 And from the new business side, we absolutely are in the market regarding the surplus and technical interest rates we offer in the market.",162,Yes
"Well, that's another question. But, of course, if you calculate with a return of 7.5%, 8% for shares, and 3% to 4% for bonds, it's quite clear that the possibility to get surpluses is lower.
 But since we are, with the market rates, as close to the guarantee level as we are now, it just means that the policyholder takes not enough risk to finance a more aggressive asset allocation; so, the shareholder takes it all.
 And so, if you compare it to other competitors, they have an even more conservative asset allocation. So I think, from market point of view, the competitive position is still intact.",107,Yes
"No, I think we've covered pretty well what our situation is, and I thank everybody for attending our conference call. I hope that we've been clear and concise, and left no doubts in anyone's mind. And if there are doubts, they should be addressed now. But since I don't seem to hear any, I will thank you again for your participation, and look forward to speaking to you again some 90 days from now. Thank you very much.",78,No
"Well, Michael, it's easier said than done, and it's a lot more expensive than most people think it is. There are two ways to do it. You can hire your own sales force, which I would think would be about 50 people to be able to hit all of those stores, because you're talking somewhere around 30,000 stores. So it would take a lot of people, and it's a very, very big investment for a Company of our size. The other way to do it is to go to other wholesalers. I mean, there are other people who will do this service, but they would get pretty much the same terms and conditions that we grant to Perfumania. So I think it boils down to a decision of do we invest in that kind of an infrastructure, and does it return enough to us to be able to make it work for us. Remember, we don't do any display activity for any of that stuff. We don't have any costs for any of that stuff that goes through Perfumania. We sell to them, it's a clean sale, and there's no return. And it's just a very simple and very profitable operation for us. So yes we could. I don't think at this point in time we are ready to make that kind of an investment and to take that kind of a risk.",233,Yes
"Well, first, let me say that my comment regarding shoppers going from Macy's to Target was generally an overall statement covering all merchandise, and not specifically to fragrances. It is true that the broader market is a much-larger one. It's also true that it is at a lower price, sometimes discounted, sometimes not discounted, and we do have efforts to get into that market and, frankly, we do it quite effectively. We do it with our Paris products, we do it with selected other products. But some things needed to be treated with precision and care in that department store market, so as not to damage their image, et cetera, et cetera. But I would say that we would continue to seek opportunity in the broader mass market while retaining a very strong position in the department stores, because that's what makes the mass market sales growth.",147,Yes
"So the issue, Mark, that you're pointing there, is that we don't recognize the profits until there is completion of the buildings. Before, we used to report on a percentage of completion basis, so things would -- so the returns would work their way in over the -- as the buildings were actually being -- the units were being constructed and delivered. So, depends on the length of time that it takes for that project to be actually constructed and delivered from the time of launch, so depending on whether you're talking about a launch or a contracted sale, that could be anywhere from, let's say, 18 months to three years. Three years would be well on the outside. And the margins is going to depend, to a certain degree, on what category of property that they are working on, and Bruce, maybe you can add some color on this in terms of the types of margins that they typically report.",161,Yes
"Okay. So, I think perhaps the way to think about that is where the assets -- Okay. Let me address that from two areas. One angle of your question may be, in terms of the properties that are being sold between us and Brookfield properties, really that's dealing with the assets and liabilities that are within the Australasia section of our office properties, but then there's also the one asset that's in our development properties. In terms of our disclosures, Andrew, those numbers will continue to be consolidated onto our books. The only difference is we'll have a half interest in it. So, if you think about it, given the transaction side, it's roughly half of that transaction will become a minority interest on our books. So, that's the way I would think about it.",135,Yes
"I guess I'd -- the comment I would make is, what is, for everyone's benefit is, essentially what it's done is, it's backed off sales and net income in short-term, and gives you a better higher growth rate in the future, within that business, and the margins depend on whether it's in -- which city it's in, and then whether we're building office or residential, and it varies in all the different categories.",73,Yes
"Linda, I would add to Brian's comments, and to say that appraisals are usually backward-looking, and the fact is, they often take a long time to change their view on where values end up. I don't think they've really, valuations, taken into account the fact that we're in this environment. And people are slow to bring discount rates down and Cap rates down. What we can tell you is an indication, we have been selling small properties out of opportunity funds and different things, and, if you have a very well leased property that has income off of it, it's incredible what you can sell it for today. Because people in a zero interest rate environment are looking to earn a 6% or 7% solid return, and that, eventually, is going to, we think, if we stay in this lower interest rate environment, it's going to bring the discount rates and the Cap rates down dramatically, which means the values of a lot of the assets we have are going up, and it will all be determined, whether, ""you stay in a low interest rate environment or not,"" but if what you said comes about, I think that's what happens to the values of assets like these.",207,Yes
"And whether we could achieve, I think what you're getting at, Brendan, is could we achieve, it's Brian, some of the same benefits with respect to leasing relationships by BAM and BPO working together on those sorts of -- with those relationships, and I guess in theory, you should be able to, in some ways, but I think the reality of it is that those types of opportunities are better capitalized on in this type of business, we think if it's within the same organization. And also, one of the things, too, is we do believe that this will create a truly special company with a security that should trade extremely well given the global profile of it.",118,No
"Sure. We clearly have capacity, in terms of our interest rate risk, to take some modest positions in securities. We purchased the municipals that were kind of intermediate range, so they might range from 10 to 15 years primarily. We are buying some very short-term structured mortgage-backeds, all agencies and all strong credit, so credit isn't an issue. It's totally the interest rate risk that we look at. But even if you can get, which we did on our mortgaged backs, around 3.5% for average lives of between 3.5 and 5 years, that seemed like, at least in a measured portion, a worthwhile deployment of our assets. So while we do anticipate that rates will go up in about a year, the interest we would have lost by doing nothing seemed to justify those purchases.",135,Yes
"On an annual basis, from 3-31-09, 30 to 90 days was a little over $12 million, and it's now over $14 million. It has been down in between, but the total of all 30 to 90, 90-plus in non-accruals is just down slightly over March 31, '09 and just about flat with 12-31-09.",53,No
"I didn't know that banking still contained the words ""releasing reserves"", so you take me a little by surprise. But I think we think that, even as we grow the portfolio, there will be a requirement for more reserves even if the coverage becomes lower as the growth becomes more significant. So I don't think releasing reserves in a growing environment is really within our strategy at the moment.
  Andy Stapp. But the reserve coverage of loans could be down by year-end?",82,Yes
"I think they are across the lines of the credit book, John, and I don't think anything startling. There was a little less than $3 million in charge-offs, and they really were spread really not much in construction, about $300,000, and very little in consumer, but otherwise just spread across the book.",52,No
"I'm going to have to ask either Frank or Paul. Which of you would like to do this? Is there -- Frank, if not, we will get back to you on the allocation to prepaid of noninterest income and average balances, but do either of you have those numbers at hand?",51,Yes
"No, we're setting that we might have some response through this quarter that would enable us to react on the third quarter, receive maybe some contracts, and start operations between the last quarter of this year and first quarter of next year. You have to be aware that some of the clients and one especially announced the opening of their plants in [Kerataro], no, so they're also in a position that they need the suppliers to start delivering them components, no.",81,Yes
"We normally don't share or don't give forecasts on increase of sales and things like that. I can tell you that figures are expected to be close to two digits of increases for the year. On the MegaMex side, we share with the market that we were expecting the MegaMex joint venture to generate sales of $200 million this year. So, that's more or less what I can share with you. Normally, we don't give estimates of what we expect. But -- because we don't control demand, no, and especially --",91,Yes
"So it's a combination of commercial and industrial and residential full requirements, provider of last resort like contracts. Not dissimilar from BGS except we're supplying those not from our assets but from the market and that's why we mark them to market and what you're seeing in our numbers as we update those marks for a change in value to those contracts we take that through the P &amp; L immediately and it is primarily from customer switching and primarily in the commercial and industrial. We don't see much of it happening on the residential side, we don't see much of it happening on the residential side in BGS either, primarily commercial and industrial so as those expectations based on that migration occurs we have to adjust our hedges to make sure we're hedged consistent with our volume expectations.",139,Yes
"Well you would think that would be an easy question to answer, right? But the question becomes when do you get permits to do what part of the line? So for example, if you had State permits to work outside of the Park Service you can get a good portion of the line under way. I think we've estimated publicly that between 70% to 80% of the line CapEx was on the Eastern portion, but if the permit for the Eastern portion are held up until the Western portion is fully approved, of course in fairness, to regulators we never used to talk about an Eastern or Western portion, Susquehanna to Roseland line, right? And it needs to be one overall comprehensive project, so it's not just as straightforward as one might guess so if everything is held up until everything is approved, then you're looking at a two to three year construction program.",154,No
"Yes, we certainly did have that benefit, obviously as I mentioned depending on how you count the numbers in the utility from the fixed demands in addition to the observed increase in volume, we did benefit from weather as we cited to about $0.05 to $0.06 per share this quarter and obviously July has been warm earlier in the quarter but we don't predict higher weather out to the rest of the year, we just predict normal weather.",78,No
"Sure. So we have SO2 allowances that we hold on our books, and just if you want the accounting, the lower of cost or market hold of those allowances. These are allowances that came on to our books related to asset acquisitions of a number of years ago. The SO2 market is a traded market so you can observe the prices in the market. They have typically for many years been well above the carrying value on our books for these allowances. What happened if you look at this market and there's actually an article in the journal a couple weeks about this, when the EPA draft rules came out, there was an expectation these allowances would not be able to be used for some of the purposes that have previously thought they would be useful relative to EPA regulation so the value of those traded allowances went down very significantly, in fact if you just looked at that value from the beginning of June on the traded market to the end of June you would see those allowances in price eroding from the high teens to about $4.",189,Yes
There's a reason why I'm reluctant to do that and you'll know what I'm about to say Paul is that's part of the green part of the BGS bar chart that we show folks and we try not to break that out for competitive reasons and basis is not a fully liquid traded product.,54,Yes
"Well, that was just coincidence that it will be at the same time. We knew the shaft was back in action and we would get certainly productivity increases and efficiencies because of that. It was just unfortunate these safety issues arose at the same time as our shaft was out of action and we had crusher break downs.
 But these are operating issues; there is nothing major here. We just get over them and move on.
 And we will see, as we saw two or three things all come together the wrong way in May and June, similarly they are all coming together in the right way in this quarter with respect to the crusher is back up and in action and that is working well. The vertical shaft is working well, saving us all sorts of time and money with respect to tramming operations. And at the same time those crews will be back in action.
 So a little bit of swings and roundabouts. We will pick it up and we are doing so.",175,Yes
"We are actually close. We took on new people but they weren't new to mining, so they have got to be familiarized and inducted into our systems and go through our pretty rigid training program. But I see the numbers on a daily/weekly basis so I am very confident that we will pick that up, if we haven't already.
 Our main concern is we could push harder but there are safety issues when you are taking a lot of people down that aren't familiar with the mine or familiar with our protocols. But I am not concerned at that stage and I would say that we are pretty close to being there now. I think you will see those numbers when we push them out.",125,No
"And also remember the tailings recovery is much, much lower. We are not getting 80% recovery, don't forget, from the tailings. So when you said about increasing -- trying to correlate it with respect to the ounces, tailings recovery is a lot, lot lower than 80% that we get from run-of-mine ore which is obviously why we ditch the tailings as soon as our run-of-mine ore comes back.",68,Yes
"They like our chemical -- our grade of chrome is good, and I am not a chrome chemical expert, but they like our chemical grade chrome. We have never not had a buyer for it. As fast as we can ship it down to the coast they buy it from us and actually that is all we care about.",59,Yes
"We put the press release out about a month ago on how we were going to approach the development of the projects and the phased approach and the type of money that will be involved. And that is as far as we want to go at this time.
 With respect to breaking down as to how those amounts will be found with respect to equity -- debt and equity, etc., that decision you will have to wait for.",78,No
"The targets for the cost savings remain as they were and what we said is we are on track to hit those cost targets GBP49m --- GBP48.8m. I think if the question is if more Strategic Partners goes are there more costs to be done, I'd observe a couple of things.
 David briefly mentioned the headwind of the share-based payments is GBP3.5m that we've got yet maintained the cost reduction target at GBP48.8m. And secondly that was a pro forma on 2010 a few years ago and there is natural inflation in everything we do and the number of the costs that we have. And I think what I would observe against that is we are managing the business with those known and some of the unknown flows, and are probably somewhat ahead of that given that we've already absorbed those two factors in maintaining the fact that we are on target. As we see what the outcome of the Strategic Partners is, we'll continue to look at that, sure.",170,No
"Okay. I'll take the Sherborne question and you take the other --- no, no, sit down. I think the first question you wanted was about Achmea. I'm not sure that we've ever said that we'll keep 70% of the assets. I think what we have said is that there --- we have had a dialogue that we will continue to run some of the Achmea assets post that period of exclusivity and we believe that is going to be the case in certain product areas, pretty much in line with the numbers that we had at the time of the strategic review. So I pretty much stick by those. Exactly what they are and things like that is to be determined prior to October this year. We'll keep you updated.
 In terms of an update on flows generally, the flows in gross terms so far this year have been reasonably strong, certainly in resale and to some extent in wholesale. However, we are -- whilst we've tried hard to stabilize the flows in some of the (inaudible) products, they have continued in the first quarter. So on a net basis I think the mixture is --- sorry, the picture is slightly mixed. But certainly retail and wholesale have started the year in gross terms well.
 I'm going to hand it to you.",222,Yes
"Okay. I'll start on the first one, the institutional business. I think the hit rate is, as you rightly say, extremely high. It is relatively focused as well in a specific product area, which is the liability-driven investment area. I think the change in the hit rate, which is the important thing, is really the transition that you see through time in building those relationships and understanding the investment consultants, which you're not only buy-rated and on short lists, but you're on short lists to win. And clearly that is the next stage in that process and then you start to really get that effect coming through.
 So I think it is high. It's very much related to the LDI business and to commensurate revenue yields that you'd see on those types of --- of that type of business. But I think the important thing is that it's relative improvement in win rates, it's absolute levels of being put forward for pitches that's we're getting and real numbers of clients that we're getting. And then we can start to build that consumer strategy more broadly and looking at the opportunities to cross sell other products to them, including the return-style products as well as just the hedging products.",208,Yes
"The pipeline is in part merely a timing question because obviously within the institutional business you get a substantial awarded but under-funded. It is -- unlike a retail or a wholesale business, it doesn't tend to fund within days or even weeks. It tends to be much longer term particularly in some of the areas that I was talking about earlier that we've been concentrating, like liability-driven investment. So the pipeline's only a snapshot in time, is a sign of where we are in that timeline. The hit rate won't really affect the pipeline per se.",96,Yes
"It's, obviously it's a multi-faceted challenge because it's not a binary outcome. So if you don't lose all of them it depends what one needs to do. Clearly what we're trying to do is engage with those strategic partners and understand what they want from us if anything post the period of exclusivity, and make sure that we're resourced accordingly. So we will continue to look at the cost base in light of what the strategic partners inform us that they are doing. And we'll keep you informed as and when they inform us, as we always do.",98,No
"I would add to that that I think really only recently, within the last year to 18 months, the bank lending, particularly as it relates to commercial real estate, has really started to increase. It's still far below it was during the last cycle and it's now just recovering. So additional liquidity in the market will help with those volumes.",60,No
"In terms of branding, as I understand it -- John, correct me if I'm wrong -- we're done on branding. It was a major undertaking and we're really quite happy with the results, for all kinds of reasons.
 In terms of acquisitions and using Curry as an example, Curry didn't have the advantages that we did in many areas. They were an extremely well managed business, but didn't have shared services, didn't have many of the ancillaries that we have, insurance, lock box, and a variety of other things, all of which we are now deep with them in terms of implementing them.
 So we have been successful over the years at enhancing the EBITDA that we acquire by adding some unique products and services to clients, but also reducing overall operating costs at the branch level.
 There's a difference, obviously, between high-rise management and low-rise management, although we're seeing -- and Scott may want to add a little bit here. But we're seeing lots more high-rise, mid-rise construction happening again in various parts of the US, primarily in major markets, which is all good for us. And so, that is the area of business where we believe we can add more value in terms of energy procurement and a variety of other things, which makes us more essential to our clients in those markets.
 Scott, did you --",229,Yes
"Well, I think it's the same old story, Frederic. First and foremost we're looking for attractive, accretive acquisition opportunities, which obviously fit with our strategy and will help strengthen our businesses. That's first and foremost where we'll go.
 We'll continue to manage carefully our capital expenditures. I did speak about some extra CapEx that we will have with respect to New York, which is an expensive place to build an office, but something that's needed and I think will really support our business going forward there. That's first and foremost where it's going to go.
 And as I'm sure we'll get into later on, there's lots of acquisition opportunities out there to pursue. But it's a great position to be in, having a very strong balance sheet at this time in the cycle. And we're very pleased to be where we are today.",143,No
"Well, yes, 2014 will have a little bit of a carryover as relates to this New York CapEx, which will be, in the aggregate, about $10 million. So that will be added on to what I would have expected to be kind of a mid-to-high $30 millions. So we'll probably end up north of $40 million again next year.
 And then, beyond that, normalize that to the upper $30 millions to $40 million. I guess as we grow the business overall, we'll expect it to continue. I think on the sort of medium term we would look at CapEx as being approximately 20% of our overall EBITDA. And we're running a little bit higher than that right now, but as we grow the business that percentage should decline slightly.",129,No
"Well, the balance sheet is strong this quarter and, as John might confirm, our seasonally strong balance sheet quarter is actually year end. So we expect it to get much stronger by year end. ] The second part of your questions is -- no. We have always been opportunistic in terms of acquisitions and careful in the way we spend our capital. So if a great opportunity presented itself, we would be there. We always believed we had the fire power regardless of where our balance sheet was. We now are in a much more fortunate position that way. But it is all going to be can we find accretive acquisitions that could be integrated well into our existing platform and add value to FirstService shareholders.
 So I hate to sound like a broken record, but it's been the same since sort of Day One for us on that.",149,No
"Actually, we are well down the path. In the Pinnacle DIP agreement and the agreement to bring them out of bankruptcy, we have the right to retire their entire 140 airplane fleet of 50-seaters. And if you'll recall, the Bombardier transaction that we did earlier this year for 40 firm and 30 option, 76-seaters, they have facilitated the removal of 60 of those airplanes, and we have a clear path to get down in the range of 100 to 125 within the next 18 to 24 months.",87,Yes
"This is Paul. There is no hard and fast rule. We are working with the accountants on that. And the reversal has to do with historical earnings and where we are on book tax differences. So, as we continue to work through that, that is something that could happen in 2013.",51,No
The pension unfunded liability is going to increase at year-end by about $2 billion. That has a minimal effect on expense based on where we are in amortization and the result of a lower interest rate. And there is no material change in funding because we have the benefits of the airline relief under the Pension Protection Act.,58,No
"What we said is that after the results of this $1 billion are fully baked in, we would expect to see forward-looking trends of flat to 2% CASM off of 2013 levels. So it is a combination of 2012 base as well as anticipated growth in cost, but we are flattening out unit costs based on that 2013 level.",59,No
"I would make two key points there. The first, if you think back to Airlines like Skybus, $2 billion of capital is no longer available. With the new Basel rules and the rules in the US on the requirements for banks and financial markets to keep capital in reserve, it is a much different situation in terms of capital in the marketplace.
 The second piece of that is, Brent is at about $1.10 and that model is a very difficult model at these sorts of fuel prices. So, when you look at where the capital markets and how the capital markets approach financing airlines today, and look at where fuel prices are today, I think we are in a very different dynamic.",122,No
"Sure. So, yes, it was specific to vending. We did see improvement again in our payment solutions business. Looking on a year-to-date basis, that business, from a core growth perspective, is up around 6%, 6.5%. So, we feel very good about the momentum that we're seeing in our payment solutions business, as well as in the margins in that business, which remain in the mid to high teens. So, a strong performance in Q3, as well as following the strong performance we saw in the first half of the year.",90,Yes
"As opposed to the project being delayed. Frankly, I think the better way to say it is that typically we see projects in our funnel being delayed prior to getting that quote. Typically if you quote it, they're at the point where they're going to do it, although there are some delays there, too, in there. It's hard to answer that, Matt.",62,Yes
"So, we -- I wouldn't say we expect a significant step change in performance over the run rate that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. It's going to be more of a slow growth environment. I think domestically, bottlers continue to communicate the long-term strategy of the importance to vending in their business.
 And in addition to the bottler activity that we're pursuing, we see opportunities to develop in emerging markets. We're looking hard at opportunities in Russia, Asia, the Middle East. And as we discussed at our investor day, our focus on cashless, as well as opportunities to grow in coffee in Europe. So, overall, on following the comments on the bottlers and the impact that we've seen year to date this year, I would say that we don't expect a dramatic step change increase as we think about 2014.",143,Yes
"So, no different, Matt, really than -- we have this formal process that we've talked about, about each of the businesses presenting ideas and concepts. And then we have sort of a top-down approach for other types of acquisitions that we look at. No different activity level has been high, remaining the same. We continue to look to deploy our capital that we have available, even post the MEI acquisition.
 And the comment that Eric made with respect to the cash being largely overseas just be mindful that a good reason for that is because we're going to use a good chunk of that to acquire the MEI business.",109,Yes
"Yes, so, we delivered 14.5% in the quarter. This was not a surprise to us. We discussed on the second-quarter call that we expected Q3 margins to be lower than the second-quarter performance that we had, primarily relating to the seasonal nature of our valve services business, which commands fairly high margins. And we also spoke to a more unfavorable mix in the third quarter related to lower MRO versus project. So, those two things led us to guide everybody down to a more modest level, if you want to call it, at 15%.
 If I look year to date, we are at, I think, 15.1% year to date in fluid handling, which is up from the guidance that we have for our full year of, I think, 14.3%. And we feel confident that we'll achieve a similar performance in the fourth quarter -- to achieve 15%.",147,Yes
"Yes, we will be equity accounting for the transaction and we'll be showing 40% of the assets in our -- within our asset line.
 In terms of your second question, again, I think the answer is just yes. It's going to be 40% of that in what we expect to be a growing business.",54,Yes
"Only showing -- trying to give a representation of where is the diversity of the Group. We are -- still have a Property business. It is now a separately owned company and that's one of the benefits of why I think its growth will be good. But I think for someone looking at the core group for Henderson, they should see us having exposure to property. It'll clearly be lower than the 20% of our assets under management that are represented there. But we still have close to 10% of the Group's assets under management where we have exposure to property. And a lot of the people who look at the business and a lot of our shareholders can see the diversity of the asset classes we're in and I think not to show it at all would give a misleading picture between equity and fixed income of our business compared to we do have that diversity. And what we've seen over the last 10 years is that Property definitely moves differently to Equities and Fixed Income. And I think that's been a strength of the firm. And I don't think we lose through this transaction that diversity or balance.",200,Yes
"Yes, well that's correct. The transaction fees that we get through from Property, which are down in the first half because the property transactions have been lower, as I mentioned earlier, and they will not be in -- going forward, once the deal completes, obviously they won't come through. We'll just have the one line in the associates for the overall profits, which will include that.
 And you are right, it's in the 60s in terms of what's really recurring. Probably two-thirds are recurring on that basis.",87,No
"Okay, well I'm conscious that there's a lot of other things going on today, so I'll close it there.
 If you have any further questions, feel free to come back to the Investor Relations department. Andrea or Tony are happy to take any further questions, but thank you for your time.",51,No
"And Nick, if the flow picture changes from where it looks like today, or if the investment performance falls away from where it is today, then there is scope for us to actually bring the compensation ratio down from that.
 We are being prudent and, given how the business is travelling, I think the view is we feel that, given that and given the strong numbers coming through on a number of different metrics, that's where we'll be for the full year.
 It may come down if that doesn't materialize as it currently looks. And also I'd say -- staff -- managing that variable cost line has been something I think we've done very well. And staff have clearly been impacted in the variable side as income has come down in previous years. I think with income going up there is a little bit of catch-up for staff, and the competitive pressure is probably building out there with our peers. You've seen some high-profile names and changes in the UK marketplace. We want to make sure that we're on the right side of what we need to do around our talent.
 So that's where -- so it is a bit of a shift from what we may have said six months ago, but it's a reflection of both the momentum in the Business and the competitive position we see ourselves in. But even in those results you've seen it absorbed in the profits we are delivering.",246,No
Yes we've demonstrated that before. Asps have never really gone up on the existing products so designed in over years and so we've had pricing pressure for years. I've been here more than 30 years and I don't remember not having an industry that had pricing pressure but by driving to better manufacturing practices and driving engineering to make sure the next design that's going to replace that product or bring in additional market has better margins starting is how you sort of beat that issue.,86,Yes
"Well, I think we're probably in the 40-ish, 30% to 40% range, 35%. We have activities going on now that would increase that. There are some things that would never move for particular reasons that we have outside the factories they're in now but we're going through a transition right now with additional products moving into Mexico that probably take another two, 2.5, three quarters to finish and that will help the gross margin out. We're not ready to give an exact number on it but it should help keep improving gross margin. That's another way, as I mentioned, manufacturing strategy and techniques.",103,Yes
"Yes if you look at the third quarter guidance we're probably at a higher than 50%. I think it just reflects, as we start putting more through the factory and get better utilization and mix, it's a slightly better margin than that but in general I think normally we expect that 50%.",52,Yes
"Thank you. So I'll re-emphasize again the tone at the recent Semicon was trade show was very positive regarding the long-term demand in the semiconductor market through a number of customers and reports and forecasts for 2014 predict strong equipment growth as chip manufacturers implement plans for 20 nanometer features and 3G chip designs, which will require more processing steps and more process equipment. As the global economy continues to stabilize and grow, we're optimistic about the opportunities for MKS in both the semiconductor markets and in the other advanced markets we serve.
 So thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to updating you on our Q3 call in October.",116,Yes
"Yes so you're right the OEMs we're up 26% so that was strong and represented most of that growth. the fabs were down a bit and I think part of that is our fab activity is usually project material and also typically comes after the tools go in so one of the largest pieces of our fab business is RGAs so once the tools are in, RGAs s would get installed onto the tools so sometimes there's a delay in that and it's definitely lumpy. It's not a steady flow of business. It's tools, certain tool sets. It's certain customers come in and then they would potentially do RGA.
 The other part of it is we do a lot of work on the fab hookup and I believe a couple of quarters before that we had some stronger fab business holding up so there's lumpiness to the fab business. There's some smaller parts, spare parts and replacements; they don't make up the majority of the fab business, typically ozone type systems or RGAs would typically make up the larger lumpy demand and that was down a little bit for the quarter.",191,Yes
"You know that we prefer not to enter into the analysis of every specific factor in a short period of time. We manage the business globally. We manage the business, of course, thinking about not only the short term but also the medium and the long term. And this is what drives our expansion plan. This is what drives the evolution of the business. So from the point of view of the big trends in the evolution of the business, nothing very different from what we were talking about in the full-year results presentation.",94,No
"You know that we don't like to elaborate very much on the -- on any aspect of the gross margin regarding one particular quarter. In terms of the gross margin for the full year, at the beginning of the year, in the 2012 full-year results presentation, we were talking about the stable gross margin for the year, considering stable, as we always say, plus or minus 50 basis points, because as far as you know, there are many, many elements that have a lot to do with the gross margin.
 Of course it has to do with markups. It has to do with markdowns. But it also has to do with product mix, with fashion trend, with like-for-like sales growth. It has to do with currencies. It has to do with many different things. But having everything in mind, we were saying at the beginning of the year that we're expecting a broadly stable gross margin during the year.
 Of course, in the year 2012 we had a very good evolution of the gross margin, particularly in the spring/summer season. But globally for the year it was also a positive evolution of the gross margin. But at this stage we prefer to continue talking about our guidance for the full year, which is a stable gross margin for the year.",220,Yes
"Well, Richard, you know that this is a -- too precise for a quarter. What you can mention in this quarter is that the space growth is in line. The store openings are on line as well.
 Obviously the first quarter has seen significant activity in terms of an enlargement of the stores, introduction of the new image in 25 of our top flagships. So to talk about the different factors operating on space growth or space comparison over a short period of time is not relevant.
 What we can tell is that we have our full confidence in the space growth plan for the year, the store openings. Everything remains on track. You see that we have also, linked to that, delivered positive like-for-like in the quarter against very demanding comparables, which we believe is very relevant. And that like-for-like is also building up on the second quarter over the first-quarter numbers. So clearly it's just a start for the year and the year remains absolutely on plan.",169,Yes
"Well you know that we are present in Morocco. We are present in South Africa. And we will see, depending on the evolution of the different countries, depending on the evolution of shopping malls in the different countries. Of course it's an area of the world that we could consider in the future, of course.
 And in South Africa we are quite happy with the evolution of our business, the [reception]. Of course South Africa is quite a developed market and country from every point of view. And we have been very well received since the first opening, in a similar way as we were very well received in Australia. You know that we began our operations there the same year as in Australia, in the year 2011. And now we are more and more consolidated in the market and very appreciated by our customers.",145,No
